{"markdown": "# Kubernetes (K8s)\n\n[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/569/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/569) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kubernetes/kubernetes?sort=semver)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/raw/master/logo/logo.png\" width=\"100\">\n\n----\n\nKubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]\nacross multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,\nand scaling of applications.\n\nKubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running\nproduction workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],\ncombined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\n\nKubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).\nIf your company wants to help shape the evolution of\ntechnologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,\nand microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.\nFor details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,\nread the CNCF [announcement].\n\n----\n\n## To start using K8s\n\nSee our documentation on [kubernetes.io].\n\nTake a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].\n\nTo use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).\nUse of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.\n\n## To start developing K8s\n\nThe [community repository] hosts all information about\nbuilding Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code\nand documentation, who to contact about what, etc.\n\nIf you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:\n\n##### You have a working [Go environment].\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\ncd kubernetes\nmake\n```\n\n##### You have a working [Docker environment].\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\ncd kubernetes\nmake quick-release\n```\n\nFor the full story, head over to the [developer's documentation].\n\n## Support\n\nIf you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],\nand work your way through the process that we've outlined.\n\nThat said, if you have questions, reach out to us\n[one way or another][communication].\n\n[announcement]: https://cncf.io/news/announcement/2015/07/new-cloud-native-computing-foundation-drive-alignment-among-container\n[Borg]: https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html\n[CNCF]: https://www.cncf.io/about\n[communication]: https://git.k8s.io/community/communication\n[community repository]: https://git.k8s.io/community\n[containerized applications]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\n[developer's documentation]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel#readme\n[Docker environment]: https://docs.docker.com/engine\n[Go environment]: https://go.dev/doc/install\n[kubernetes.io]: https://kubernetes.io\n[Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes]: https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615\n[troubleshooting guide]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/\n\n## Community Meetings \n\nThe [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.\n\n## Adopters\n\nThe [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.\n\n## Governance \n\nKubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles, values, policies and processes to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals.\n\nThe [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.\n\nThe [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.\n\n## Roadmap \n\nThe [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) provides information about Kubernetes releases, as well as feature tracking and backlogs.\n"}
