Panel plugins offer many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.\n- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.\n- **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.\n- **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.\n- **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.\n- **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.\n\n## Get started\n\n- [Get Grafana](https://grafana.com/get)\n- [Installation guides](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/)\n\nUnsure if Grafana is for you?
