The latest released Xcode versions and the \nprior version are supported.\n\nInstalling and updating CocoaPods is very easy. Don't miss the [Installation\nguide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation) and the\n[Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).\n\n## Project Goals\n\nCocoaPods aims to improve the engagement with, and discoverability \nof, third party open-source Cocoa libraries. These\nproject goals influence and drive the design of CocoaPods:\n\n- Create and share libraries, and use them in your own projects,\n  without creating extra work for library authors. Integrate\n  non-CocoaPods libraries and hack on your own fork of any\n  CocoaPods library with a simple transparent `Podspec` standard.\n- Allow library authors to structure their libraries however they like.\n- Save time for library authors by automating a lot of Xcode work not \n  related to their libraries' functionality.\n- Support any source management system. (Currently supported are `git`, \n  `svn`, `mercurial`, `bazaar`, and various types of archives downloaded over HTTP.)\n- Promote a culture of distributed collaboration on pods, but also provide\n  features only possible with a centralised solution to foster a community.\n- Build tools on top of the core Cocoa development system, including those \n  typically deployed to other operating systems, such as web-services.\n- Provide opinionated and automated integration, but make it completely\n  optional. You may manually integrate your CocoaPods dependencies\n  into your Xcode project as you see fit, with or without a workspace.\n- Solve everyday problems for Cocoa and Xcode developers.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nLovingly sponsored by a collection of companies, see the footer of [CocoaPods.org](https://cocoapods.org) for an up-to-date list. \n\n## Collaborate\n\nAll CocoaPods development happens on GitHub. Contributions make for good karma and\nwe [welcome new](https://blog.cocoapods.org/starting-open-source/) contributors with joy. We take contributors seriously, and thus have a \ncontributor [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Links\n\n| Link | Description |\n| :----- | :------ |\n[CocoaPods.org](https://cocoapods.org/) | Homepage and search for Pods.\n[@CocoaPods](https://twitter.com/CocoaPods) | Follow CocoaPods on Twitter to stay up to date.\n[Blog](https://blog.cocoapods.org) | The CocoaPods blog.\n[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/cocoapods) | Feel free to ask any kind of question.\n[Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org) | Everything you want to know about CocoaPods.\n[Changelog](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) | See the changes introduced in each CocoaPods version.\n[New Pods RSS](https://feeds.cocoapods.org/new-pods.rss) | Don't miss any new Pods.\n[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Find out the standards we hold ourselves to.\n\n## Projects\n\nCocoaPods is composed of the following projects:\n\n| Status    | Project | Description | Info |\n| :-------- | :------ | :--- | :--- |\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/workflows/Specs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/actions/workflows/Specs.yml) | [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) | The CocoaPods command line tool. | [guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org)\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/workflows/Specs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/actions/workflows/Specs.yml) | [CocoaPods Core](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core) | Support for working with specifications and podfiles. | [docs](https://guides.cocoapods.org/contributing/components.html)\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/workflows/Specs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader/actions/workflows/Specs.yml) |[CocoaPods Downloader](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-downloader) |  Downloaders for various source types. |  [docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cocoapods-downloader)\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/workflows/Specs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj/actions/workflows/Specs.yml) | [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj) | Create and modify Xcode projects from Ruby. |  [docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/xcodeproj)\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide/actions/workflows/ci.yml) | [CLAide](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CLAide) | A small command-line interface framework.  | [docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/claide)\n| [![Build Status](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo/actions/workflows/test.yml) | [Molinillo](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo) | A powerful generic dependency resolver.  | [docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/molinillo)\n|  | [Master Repo ](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs) | Master repository of specifications. | [guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/specs-and-specs-repo.html)\n"}
