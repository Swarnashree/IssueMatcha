This behavior is observed regardless of the device or browser being used. The issue specifically occurs when the direction is set to RTL; switching back to LTR (dir=\"ltr\") resolves the issue and the month changes as expected when the arrows are clicked. This problem presents a significant usability concern for RTL users, who cannot navigate through months in the date picker.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUsers should be able to navigate through months in the ion-datetime date picker by clicking on the left or right arrows, irrespective of the text direction setting (RTL or LTR). The component should consistently allow month navigation in RTL mode, ensuring a seamless and inclusive experience for all users, including those requiring RTL layouts.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create an Ionic application that includes an ion-datetime element with presentation=\"date\" and binds it to a model with [(ngModel)]=\"datetime\".\r\n2. Wrap the ion-datetime element in a container and set the direction to RTL (dir=\"rtl\").\r\n3. Run the application and attempt to change the month in the date picker by clicking on the left or right arrows.\r\n4. Observe that clicking the arrows does not change the current month when in RTL mode, unlike when the direction is set to LTR, where the functionality works as expected.\n\n### Code Reproduction URL\n\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic-rtl-calendar-issue\n\n### Ionic Info\n\n```\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI                     : 7.2.0 (C:\\Users\\adrie\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@ionic\\cli)\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic\/angular 7.6.6\r\n   @angular-devkit\/build-angular : 17.1.1\r\n   @angular-devkit\/schematics    : 17.1.1\r\n   @angular\/cli                  : 17.1.1\r\n   @ionic\/angular-toolkit        : 11.0.1\r\n\r\nCapacitor:\r\n\r\n   Capacitor CLI      : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/android : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/core    : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/ios     : 5.6.0\r\n\r\nCordova:\r\n\r\n   Cordova CLI       : not installed\r\n   Cordova Platforms : not available\r\n   Cordova Plugins   : not available\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res : not installed globally\r\n   native-run  : 2.0.0\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v20.10.0 (C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe)\r\n   npm    : 10.2.3\r\n   OS     : Windows 10\r\n```\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","comments":["Thank you for the issue.

We ask for a repro in order to better understand the problems you're running into. Routing-related issues in particular can get complicated, so it's best to see the code directly.\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle events you've linked to are specific to routing (mapping URL paths to pages), which `IonNav` is not meant to be used for. (This is described at the top of the [Nav docs](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/nav).) The lifecycle events are not expected to fire when pushing `ExploreContainer` in an `IonNav`. `IonNav` does have its own lifecycle events, which you may find useful: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/nav#events\r\n\r\nHowever, I *would* expect the lifecycle events to fire when landing on or leaving the `\/nav-bug` path, since that triggers a routing change on the `Outside` view. This is not currently happening because `Outside` does not use the `IonPage` component, which is required for routing. If I wrap `Outside` in `<IonPage><\/IonPage>`, the lifecycle hooks fire as expected.\r\n\r\nCan you try the `IonNav` events and\/or wrapping your views in `IonPage` and let me know if that works for your use case?","Yes, the events are working, the problem is that i don't have a simple way to know when a component pushed by a nav is active or not. With the route's lifecycles that would be easy to do, but without it is nearly impossible.\r\nFor example, if i want to handle the hardware back button on each view differently with the current tools seems impossible because the \"mounted\" nav components that are hidden will be also listening to the back button and this will lead to unwanted behaviors.

The label should be more descriptive, perhaps \u201cclear search input\u201d.\n\n### Describe the Use Case\n\n\"Reset\" may be unclear to screenreader users, and so the button's `aria-label` should be more descriptive.\n\n### Describe Preferred Solution\n\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Add a prop so that consuming applications can optionally pass their own `aria-label` for the searchbar's \"clear button\".\r\n2. Update the existing `aria-label` ([here](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/5a5f330705f77a8971119fad448101a5504d8e5e\/core\/src\/components\/searchbar\/searchbar.tsx#L636)) to be something more descriptive, like \"clear search input\".\r\n\r\nThank you!!\n\n### Describe Alternatives\n\n_No response_\n\n### Related Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","comments":[],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: I need a double click to display a string in console.log using Ionic + React","body":"### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already report this problem, without success.\n\n### Ionic Framework Version\n\nv7.x\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nn my case I need to double click on the \"Login\" button to display the Email and Password\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useEffect } from 'react';\r\nimport { IonButton, IonCardContent, IonContent, IonIcon, IonInput, IonItem, IonList, IonLoading, IonPage, useIonRouter } from '@ionic\/react';\r\nimport { mailOpenOutline, lockClosedOutline } from 'ionicons\/icons';\r\n\r\nconst LoginPage: React.FC = () => {\r\n  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('');\r\n  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');\r\n  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);\r\n  const navigation = useIonRouter();\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {}, [email, password])\r\n\r\n  const handlerLogin = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\r\n    e.preventDefault();\r\n    console.log(\"set\", email, \"this email\");\r\n    console.log(\"set\", password, \"this password\");\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const signUp = () => {\r\n    navigation.push('\/register')\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <IonPage>\r\n      <IonContent className=\"ion-padding\">\r\n        <IonCardContent>\r\n          <IonList>\r\n            <form onSubmit={handlerLogin}>\r\n              <IonItem>\r\n                <IonInput\r\n                  label='Email'\r\n                  labelPlacement='stacked'\r\n                  placeholder='example@email.com'\r\n                  type='email'\r\n                  clearInput={true}\r\n                  onIonChange={(e: any) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\r\n                >\r\n                  <IonIcon slot='start' icon={mailOpenOutline} \/>\r\n                <\/IonInput>\r\n              <\/IonItem>\r\n              <IonItem>\r\n                <IonInput\r\n                  className='ion-margin-top'\r\n                  label='Password'\r\n                  labelPlacement='stacked'\r\n                  placeholder='*******'\r\n                  type='password'\r\n                  onIonChange={(e:any) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\r\n                >\r\n                  <IonIcon slot='start' icon={lockClosedOutline} \/>\r\n                <\/IonInput>\r\n              <\/IonItem>\r\n              <IonButton type='submit' expand='full' shape='round' fill='outline'>\r\n                Login\r\n              <\/IonButton>\r\n            <\/form>\r\n            <IonButton color={'danger'} expand='full' shape='round' fill='outline' onClick={() => signUp()}>\r\n              Daftar\r\n            <\/IonButton>\r\n            <IonLoading isOpen={loading} message={'Harap Tunggu'} \/>\r\n          <\/IonList>\r\n        <\/IonCardContent>\r\n      <\/IonContent>\r\n    <\/IonPage>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default LoginPage;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen I click once on the \"Login\" button on the console.log it displays an image like this\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-02-28 20-45-58](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/117837188\/57739fa2-8448-4db0-8e0f-9d5cbcd78ba6)\r\nand when I double click the \"Login\" button it will display console.log like this\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-02-28 20-47-55](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/117837188\/7d09c4f9-98ca-4277-9d0d-a163b54d352a)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI want to display the Email and Password on the console.log with just one click of the \"Login\" button, how do I do it? is there something wrong with my code?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. clone repo https:\/\/github.com\/ujangaripin24\/ionic-react-firebase-chating\r\n2. make sure you using Node 20.xx.x\r\n3. make sure you using Ionic 7.x.x\r\n4.

It works very well when we specify any values from the same month but if we supply `value` property across different months then it renders the calendar of 2021. It works in case of React but breaking in Angular. User is able to select the values from the calendar from multiple months but when the saved value or initial value that contains date across months, then it breaks.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`ion-datetime` component should accept values across different months when using with `multiple=\"true\"` with Angular. \n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nThis is for Angular example. \r\n\r\n1. Open the example [Stackblitz url](https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/run?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts) of the ion-datetime.\r\n2. In the `example.component.ts` define a property named as `selectedDates` and assign the values as `selectedDates = ['2024-02-20', '2024-03-05']` . Ensure that one date is from `February` and the other is from `March`.\r\n3. In the `example.component.html` file, pass the `selectedDates` property to the `value` attribute.\r\n4. Note that the calendar is not displaying the selected dates correctly, and it renders the calendar from the year 2021.\n\n### Code Reproduction URL\n\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/angular-qtxwpy?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.ts\n\n### Ionic Info\n\n[@angular\/animations](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/animations) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/common](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/common) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/compiler](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/compiler) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/core](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/core) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/forms](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/forms) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/platform-browser](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/platform-browser) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/platform-browser-dynamic](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/platform-browser-dynamic) 17.1.1\r\n\r\n[@angular\/router](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@angular\/router) 17.0.1\r\n\r\n[@ionic\/angular](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@ionic\/angular) 7.7.3\r\n\r\n[@ionic\/core](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@ionic\/core) 7.7.3\r\n\r\n[rxjs](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/rxjs) 7.8.1\r\n\r\n[tslib](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/tslib) 2.6.2\r\n\r\n[zone.js](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/zone.js) 0.14.2\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","comments":["@thetaPC I found that this issue is mainly due to 1 check that is present in the line https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/5a5f330705f77a8971119fad448101a5504d8e5e\/core\/src\/components\/datetime\/datetime.tsx#L1306 .

In the case of web components, that can be an element within the shadow dom. This means applying `:focus-visible` on the host element, will not apply. This can be illustrated in this codepen: https:\/\/codepen.io\/sean-perkins\/pen\/PoLrbXY. When tabbing to the button, the inner styles that target the element that receives focus is applied, however the styles on the component host are not. \r\n\r\n`ion-item` is currently using an option to delegate focus from the content inside the shadow dom to the host element: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/e440051764fa6224a67224ef2b473ce7d51a9174\/core\/src\/components\/item\/item.tsx#L35-L37\r\n\r\nIf I can better understand what your styling needs are, I can better determine if that approach makes sense here. \r\n\r\nThanks!","Hello @FabianGutierrezOpengov, I followed up with the team further.

This suggests that while the text selection is initially successful, something causes the selection to be cleared shortly afterwards.\r\n- This issue does not occur on Chrome, where text selection within an ion-textarea works as expected and persists until the user deselects it.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- When a user focuses on an ion-textarea and triggers the selectText() method (for instance, by tapping or clicking into the text area), the entire text within the ion-textarea should be selected and highlighted. This selection should persist until the user explicitly deselects it or begins typing.\r\n- The expected behavior should be consistent across all browsers, including Safari, ensuring a uniform experience for all users regardless of their browser choice.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open an Ionic application that includes an ion-textarea element with predefined text, running on Ionic 6 or 7, in Safari on either an iOS or macOS device.\r\n2. Implement a method that selects the text within the ion-textarea upon the element gaining focus, similar to the provided selectText() method.\r\n3. Run the application and focus on the ion-textarea either by tapping (on iOS) or clicking (on macOS) to trigger the text selection.\r\n4. Observe that the text within the ion-textarea is briefly selected before the selection is cleared, differing from the behavior observed in other browsers like Chrome.\n\n### Code Reproduction URL\n\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic-textarea-select\n\n### Ionic Info\n\n```\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI                     : 7.2.0\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic\/angular 7.6.6\r\n   @angular-devkit\/build-angular : 17.1.1\r\n   @angular-devkit\/schematics    : 17.1.1\r\n   @angular\/cli                  : 17.1.1\r\n   @ionic\/angular-toolkit        : 11.0.0\r\n\r\nCapacitor:\r\n\r\n   Capacitor CLI      : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/android : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/core    : 5.6.0\r\n   @capacitor\/ios     : 5.6.0\r\n\r\nCordova:\r\n\r\n   Cordova CLI       : not installed\r\n   Cordova Platforms : not available\r\n   Cordova Plugins   : not available\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res : not installed globally\r\n   native-run  : 2.0.0\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v20.10.0 (C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe)\r\n   npm    : 10.2.3\r\n   OS     : Windows 10\r\n```\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","comments":["Hi!

However, this function is very expensive, so using it would introduce performance issues. Until a better strategy can be found that properly accounts for all cases, this PR approximates things by making a guess at the safe area margins.\r\n\r\nNote that the position of the arrow on iOS popovers has not been adjusted to account for safe area in the same way as the popover content. I chose to leave it like this because the behavior in `main` doesn't adjust the arrow either, even with the 25px guess at the safe area margin. Moving the arrow will also add complexity to account for the different values of `side`, which increases the risk of bugs. If it does need fixing, it would probably be best to do that as separate scope.\r\n\r\nThis PR has been targeted to a minor release to de-risk the behavior change.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to test the behavior is with the `adjustment` test, as this lets you present the popover from anywhere on the screen.

Screenshots are significantly slower to execute than parsing a condition of the DOM. \r\n3. This one we do inconsistently today in Ionic Framework, but we are actively trying to reduce coupling between components and tests, where they are not needed. For example, testing this behavior for `ion-picker`, does not depend on `ion-button`. We can just use a HTML `button` in this case. This is most important with screenshots, but by reducing coupling, we have significantly less risk of something else breaking\/changing in the future.

It technically works but creates a situation for us where the user can momentarily see & interact with elements that need to be gone by the time the animation is started, but need to be restored when he gesture is aborted. We use Angular content portals to project content dynamically and it needs to be in the right place at the right time.","Do you have an example of the elements that you need removed in your application?","Huh, weird timing! I was also just experiencing trouble with the lack of published events for this scenario. Below is my use case:\r\n\r\n- In my case, I have a singleton `<video>` element that I portal around the application so that playback is not interrupted. I use [react-reverse-portal](https:\/\/github.com\/httptoolkit\/react-reverse-portal) to accomplish this.\r\n- Observe video is pulled\/pushed from pages as expected, listening to `ionViewWillEnter` event to \"pull\" the `<video>` element into the correct place.\r\n- Observe at the end of the video, instead of fully swiping back, I stop swiping, and the page transition never completes.\r\n- There is no event to catch this case. `willEnter`\/`didEnter`\/`willLeave`\/`didLeave` do not get called. I don't know if this is a bug *(perhaps `willEnter` and `didEnter` should be re-called if you don't complete the swipe back?)*, or as per OP, perhaps new `ionViewDidNotEnter` and `ionViewDidNotLeave` events should be published. Either of these solutions would work for my case.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, I would be happy to create a reproduction.

Unless the video sticks to the top of the screen as you scroll, I imagine you would want to pause the video when the video scrolls out of the viewport as well. Using IntersectionObserver would let you cover both cases.\r\n\r\nI already use Intersection Observer for your mentioned case of play\/pause while scrolling feed, but it is not well suited for detecting page navigations in my testing.\r\n\r\n 1. I want to change video element location before the page animation starts to avoid stutters.\r\n 2. Furthermore using an Intersection Observer for that introduces other unavoidable edge cases, due to the fact that you cannot discern the difference between page navigation intersections and feed scroll intersections.

If you were to cleanup observables on `ionViewWillLeave` but then you don't actually complete the swipe back, your application on that page would be in a broken state, right?","> Furthermore using an Intersection Observer for that introduces other unavoidable edge cases, due to the fact that you cannot discern the difference between page navigation intersections and feed scroll intersections.

It turns out that native iOS re-triggers lifecycle events when you do not complete a swipe back. Please see the following Youtube video (linking to around 9:30):\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/wLS26PfQeAs?si=ZBBQ_irI444i24gm&t=562\r\n\r\nAs you can see, when he lifts his finger (and swipe back does not complete), the following lifecycle events in yellow are triggered. **This is different than Ionic, which does not trigger any lifecycle events when you cancel the swipe back.**\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/2166114\/4158e9c8-9bb1-4148-a5b6-5f735b34963c)","Ah that's interesting.

If the will\/did events fired when cancelling the swipe gesture would that make it easier to implement the pattern you described above?\r\n\r\nYes 100%. Though it would be a potentially breaking change for many apps rather than a new feature. You'd have to review all of your existing event handlers and make sure nothing bad happens if they are called multiple times. That's why I opted to suggest the introduction of a new API rather than overload the existing one, but I can see it going both ways if you want to keep things minimal. It just means apps will break.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while it would solve this specific case, there is some nuance to using separate events. E.g. the nature of the event is unknown if you call the same event handlers. You could do some complex state checking I guess, to determine what situation the `DidEnter` handler is being called in (e.g.: first time means page loaded, second+ time means page leave started and aborted, but only if `WillLeave` was called first).

Based on the current state of technology, this is difficult for anyone to do perfectly in all environments. Devices are notoriously inconsistent with the rendered keyboard height. \r\n\r\nWe have to use a mixed strategy of starting an animation when the keyboard show event is dispatched and doing a best guess to the animation duration & curve when animating to a fixed position relative to the keyboard height. Almost every implementation I've seen that has tried this either animates their custom content a little off from the keyboard or they wait until the keyboard has fully appeared before revealing an accessory bar. \r\n\r\nI will discuss with the team and see if we have opinions on how to best handle this. Due to the limitation of how well we can also do this out of the box, potentially documentation and\/or a blog may be better suited so developers can customize the implementation to match their device demographics best. ","@sean-perkins I feel like there should be a support group from people who've gone down the custom mobile keyboard content animate rabbit hole!\r\n\r\nA blog or a page of documentation on best practices\/ different approaches would be very valuable I think. I know long I spent looking for resources and not quite ever finding the help I wanted. \r\n\r\nPerhaps some examples of approaches to try could be included too. Recently I've been toying with animating a `transform: translateY` on a `keyboardWillShow` event with the keyboardResize mode set to `Native` - that's been quite a smooth looking transition although there's still some edge cases I need to work out.\r\n\r\nThere are truly some serious \"gotchyas\" when it comes to keyboard events too.  For example, when a keyboard  with auto-fill suggestions at it's top opens, ios actually sends two onWillShow and onDidShow events. This in particular created some headaches for creating animations as it makes it much harder to figure out if keyboard events were, from the users perspective, related to a keyboard appearing, or changing height.\r\n\r\nRecently I've been gathering some measurements from ever ios devices as it seems that keyboard heights are always consistently off by a certain amount:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"441\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 21 32 36\" src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/41165256\/c24efb1e-98ee-42fd-a109-c0823cf791be\">\r\n\r\nCan I ask, have you guys ever had any luck with this type of approach?","Hello @drakedeatonuk apologies for the delay.\r\n\r\nStatic offsets might be difficult to manage over time and respond to dynamic conditions (screen rotation, etc.). \r\n\r\nI would like to track this feature as introducing a new component\/API that enables developers to slot through custom content that can respond with reasonable accuracy to the presence of the keyboard and adapt to the height changes with features like the accessory bar.

Verify the same behavior in RTL mode.\r\n4. Verify the release and cancel behavior with quickly swiping to show\/collapse items as well as releasing the swipe gesture prior to the threshold that shows\/collapses the item. \r\n\r\n### Deep dive into the implementation\r\n\r\nThis deep dive focuses on the item options animation within this PR. It assumes you are familiar to how the existing item sliding animation behaves to translate the item to reveal options. \r\n\r\n**1. Prepare item options for animation**\r\n\r\n In order to simplify the calculations of the animation, we relocate each item option off the visible viewport to be on the edge of the screen. For example in LTR text direction, the items on the end of the container will be located on the right edge of the screen, off the viewport. \r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/13732623\/928fcc82-d182-49bb-ab2e-d06ecab403cf\" \/>\r\n  <figcaption>This image demonstrates the transformation on the x-axis to move the end options in LTR text decoration.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\nTo determine the distance to move each option, we need to define some initial values and their purposes:\r\n- `o`: This is an incrementing value that accounts for the _total_ width of all previous processed item options. For example when it processes the first item option, this resolves `0`, the next item option this would equal the width of the previous item option. On the next item option this would equal the width of the two previous item options and so on.\r\n- `tW`: The total width of all the item options. \r\n- `oW`: The width of the current item option.\r\n\r\nWith this information we can equate the distance as follows:\r\n\r\n_Side: Start_\r\n- Left-to-right text decoration: `distance = -1 * (oW + o)`\r\n- Right-to-left text decoration: `distance = -1 * (tw - o)`\r\n\r\n_Side: End_\r\n- Left-to-right text decoration: `distance = tW - o`\r\n- Right-to-left text decoration: `distance = o + oW`\r\n\r\n**2. Animate each option during swipe gesture**\r\n\r\nAs the user swipes to reveal options, there is an open amount of space to reveal all the options. We need to give each option roughly the same amount of visible viewport space.\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/13732623\/7ca4946b-8b59-4036-944a-f6b4286542c4\" \/>\r\n  <figcaption>This image demonstrates the transformation on the x-axis to move each option into the visible open space from the swipe gesture. This graphic is representative of end item options in LTR. The stacking order of the elements is important to note, so that items option are pulled from underneath each other.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\nWe are able to defer the complexity of computing the transform value as the user is dragging the item to the Web Animations API by transforming between two fixed points: the position off the viewport and the original render position, and animate based on the progress of the open amount divided by the options total width.\r\n\r\nAs a result of using a transform between two points, the amount of space that each option fills in the available space will be dependent on the width of the option. The animation effect scales evenly with options of equal width. \r\n","comments":["Dev build: 7.6.2-dev.11705694334.11b34c62"],"labels":["package: core","package: angular","package: vue"]},{"title":"bug: react, mixing nested controller and inline overlays causes event handlers to not get bound","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\r\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already report this problem, without success.\r\n\r\n### Ionic Framework Version\r\n\r\nv7.x\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n* Create and present a modal using controller method\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst [present, dismiss] = useIonModal(ModalExample)\r\n...\r\n  function openModal() {\r\n    present();\r\n  }\r\n...  \r\n```\r\n\r\n* From within the modal have a button that triggers an IonPopover \r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  <IonButton id=\"click-trigger-2\">Trigger Popover<\/IonButton>\r\n  <IonPopover dismissOnSelect trigger=\"click-trigger-2\" triggerAction=\"click\">\r\n    <IonContent class=\"ion-padding\">\r\n      Hello World!\r\n      <IonButton expand=\"block\" onClick={onClick}>I'm clickable<\/IonButton>\r\n    <\/IonContent>\r\n  <\/IonPopover>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For any element within that IonPopover (eg IonItem, IonButton, etc) any `onClick` handler will not get invoked.

The problem here appears to be due to mixing controller vs. inline usage. In particular, presenting an inline popover from a controller modal causes events to not be bound to the contents of the popover. \r\n\r\nUsing both an inline modal and inline popover avoids this issue. Similarly, using both a controller modal and controller popover avoids the issue.\r\n\r\nThis issue only reproduces in React. Both Angular and Vue allow you to mix nested controller and inline overlays as expected.\r\n\r\nedit: This also applies to any element inside of the nested popover in this case.

The root container is a parent of a Portal. It expects that the event will bubble through the Portal. However, it looks like the controller\/hook overlay uses a Portal, but the inline overlay does not.

Ionic is working as intended here, though the behavior of `keyboardClose` is not obvious and can likely be improved.\r\n\r\nBefore the overlay animation runs we blur any focused input\/textarea: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/75ffeee933ae353d2601670178896116c81923e0\/core\/src\/utils\/overlays.ts#L625-L631\r\n\r\nWe also optionally move focus into the overlay (after the animation) if `keyboardClose` is `true`: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/75ffeee933ae353d2601670178896116c81923e0\/core\/src\/utils\/overlays.ts#L508-L510\r\n\r\nWhen `keyboardClose` is `false` we skip that second line of code I mentioned.

The problem is that when calling the `close()` and `open()` methods rapidly like this, `open` doesn't wait for `close` to finish, so the item gets stuck in a weird in-between state where it is visually open but the option buttons aren't interactable. This also occurs in Ionic core. If you comment out the `close`\/`open` calls, and instead call them manually in the dev console (waiting for the animation to finish each time), the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nThe two methods currently return Promises, but `await`ing them does nothing because they aren't actually waiting for the animation to finish before resolving.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if we adjusted the methods to resolve at the proper time, this would not solve your use case since your workaround of calling `close()` and `open()` back to back would start displaying extra animations. Instead, we should get at the root problem, which is that when updating the options async, the item does not move to handle the new options, and may cover up options or leave empty space.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there are three separate issues here:\r\n1. Adding or removing options async while the item is open does not trigger the item to move again to accommodate the updated option set.\r\n2. The `open` and `close` methods do not wait for any other active animations to finish before running.\r\n3. Despite returning Promises, the `open` and `close` methods do not wait for their own animations to finish before resolving.\r\n\r\nIf we fix issue 1, 2 and 3 will become redundant as it pertains to your use case, but we should still look into them regardless.","Thanks for investigating this issue.

We think this would be a good functionality to have in Ionic. Any interest in contributing a fix to implement this? We will need to do the following to implement the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Update [closeParentOverlay](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/b833f0e826ddd261230e2e29b70e2dc884d8cb04\/core\/src\/components\/datetime\/datetime.tsx#L585) to accept a `role: string` parameter. This should be passed to the modal\/popover as `popoverOrModal.dismiss(undefined, role)` (the first parameter is optional data which we do not have here).\r\n2. Update Datetime's [confirm method](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/b833f0e826ddd261230e2e29b70e2dc884d8cb04\/core\/src\/components\/datetime\/datetime.tsx#L510) to pass `'datetime-confirm'` to `this.closeParentOverlay`.\r\n3. Update Datetime's [cancel method](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/b833f0e826ddd261230e2e29b70e2dc884d8cb04\/core\/src\/components\/datetime\/datetime.tsx#L535) to pass `'datetime-cancel'` to `this.closeParentOverlay`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the `datetime-confirm` or `datetime-cancel` naming may change during review. I'd recommend assigning these values to consts at the bottom of `datetime.tsx`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst CANCEL_ROLE = 'datetime-cancel';\r\nconst CONFIRM_ROLE = 'datetime-confirm';\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs far as tests go, we'll want to test that both the confirm and cancel roles are being passed correctly. I recommend making a new directory in `components\/datetime\/test` for this. The following tests should be sufficient:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconfigs({ modes: ['ios'], directions: ['ltr'] }).forEach(({ config, title }) => {\r\n  test.describe(title('datetime: overlay roles'), () => {\r\n    test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\r\n      await page.setContent(`\r\n        <ion-modal>\r\n          <ion-datetime><\/ion-datetime>\r\n        <\/ion-modal>  \r\n      `, config);\r\n    });\r\n    test('should pass role to overlay when calling confirm method', async ({ page }) => {\r\n      const ionModalDidDismiss = await page.spyOnEvent('ionModalDidDismiss');\r\n      const modal = page.locator('ion-modal');\r\n      const datetime = page.locator('ion-datetime');\r\n      \r\n      await modal.evaluate((el: HTMLIonModalElement) => el.present());\r\n\r\n      await datetime.evaluate((el: HTMLIonDatetimeElement) => el.confirm(true));\r\n\r\n      await ionModalDidDismiss.next();\r\n      expect(ionModalDidDismiss).toHaveReceivedEventDetail({ data: undefined, role: 'datetime-confirm' });\r\n    });\r\n    test('should pass role to overlay when calling cancel method', async ({ page }) => {\r\n      const ionModalDidDismiss = await page.spyOnEvent('ionModalDidDismiss');\r\n      const modal = page.locator('ion-modal');\r\n      const datetime = page.locator('ion-datetime');\r\n      \r\n      await modal.evaluate((el: HTMLIonModalElement) => el.present());\r\n      \r\n      await datetime.evaluate((el: HTMLIonDatetimeElement) => el.cancel(true));\r\n      \r\n      await ionModalDidDismiss.next();\r\n      expect(ionModalDidDismiss).toHaveReceivedEventDetail({ data: undefined, role: 'datetime-cancel' });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nOnce a PR is up for this I can assist with any documentation.","This issue has been labeled as `help wanted`.

The issue lies in this block here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/3d96ccb7b29d1974ab284d346cac64a143ebf41c\/core\/src\/components\/infinite-scroll\/infinite-scroll.tsx#L123-L132\r\n\r\nOnce the items are removed from the list, there are enough items to allow scrolling, but you can't scroll up far enough to cause `distanceFromInfinite` to ever rise above 0. This means that `didFire` never gets reset to `false`, so the `ionInfinite` event can't fire again. Ideally, we should just fix this rather than introduce a new API. We may need to tweak how `distanceFromInfinite` is calculated, or we could try resetting `didFire` if the height of the scroll container changes.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this in core, meaning it isn't an Angular-exclusive issue. For anyone testing locally, here are the exact steps I took:\r\n1. Host core locally and head to http:\/\/localhost:3333\/src\/components\/infinite-scroll\/test\/basic\r\n2. Scroll down to trigger the infinite scroll (but do _not_ scroll back up -- doing so will reset `didFire` back to `false` and prevent the bug from happening)\r\n3. Run the following code in the console to remove some of the items:\r\n```javascript\r\n;(() => {\r\n    let items = document.querySelectorAll('ion-list > ion-item');\r\n    items = [...items].slice(17, items.length); \/\/ may need to tweak this number for your device\r\n    items.forEach(item => item.remove());\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n4.

I'm a little confused by your response about the types. If `defaultValue` is a React-specific attribute that _doesn't_ work with IonInput, then shouldn't that property be omitted from the types that Ionic provides?\r\n\r\n![](https:\/\/p-1MFmr4.b2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com\/items\/mXuvjj4e\/35578ee2-76b7-4d48-b1aa-693ff0739cfa.jpg?v=f67611d70d091e57d16e9af309777bcd)\r\n\r\nWith regards to the implementation, I do think there are some potential footguns \u2013 especially now that the default recommendation in the React docs is to use uncontrolled inputs.\r\n\r\nSee this forked repo here: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vxete3-ojhbpn. If you only rely on `value` to set the default value of the input, you can still update the value (which aligns with the web API and not React), but the value will **reset** if anything causes the component to re-render. In the forked example, I can choose to opt out of the newsletter, but that choice will get reset after pressing \"Read more...\" \ud83d\ude31.\r\n\r\nIf the components _have_ to be controlled (i.e., setting `value` and `onIonChange` explicitly), is there somewhere in the documentation where that can be communicated to try to mitigate the issue raised above? And does this possibly affect your types?","@chawes13 appreciate the follow-up!\r\n\r\nI looked into this more and [`defaultValue`](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/HTMLInputElement#defaultvalue) is part of the instance properties for certain built-in form controls. I'll need to see how it's actually used to see if it should be something we inherit from the host and pass to the inner form control element. \r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on your forked repo? If I bind the `value` to `ion-input`, I don't see the value reset while interacting with your example: [forked example](https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vxete3-wsmalc?file=src%2Fmain.tsx). \r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm miss understanding controlled vs. uncontrolled form controls? Reading this article: https:\/\/dmitripavlutin.com\/controlled-inputs-using-react-hooks\/#1-the-controlled-input, I can do the same approach with Ionic: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vxete3-ugkdag?file=src%2Fmain.tsx\r\n ","Sorry about that! I wasn't very clear in my first example.\r\n\r\nHere's a video showing the value resetting when the component is re-rendered (triggered by pressing the controlled lifetime membership checkbox and by pressing \"Read more...\"). You'll notice that the React component (set with `defaultValue`) and the controlled input (i.e., the lifetime membership checkbox that has both `value` and `onIonChange` set do **not** have their values reset when a render is triggered.\r\n\r\n**Video**: https:\/\/share.zight.com\/z8udqA6P\r\n**Sandbox**: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vxete3-ojhbpn\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to communicate in my previous comment was that this can happen pretty easily, but it's easy to miss. If you're going to set the `value` of the input, then you _have_ to set the `onIonChange` handler or else you will be susceptible to this defect if the component re-renders for any reason. In React-land, you'll actually get a console warning if you forget to apply the onChange handler when `value` is included:\r\n![](https:\/\/p-1MFmr4.b2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com\/items\/o0uKkNJy\/fa9bcb81-7452-40fd-80ad-77f78c320cc8.jpg?v=06ff3855b7c2c798de9eecb19a468f8b)\r\n\r\nLastly, you can see that the `defaultValue` attribute is accepted as part of the web API for text inputs. The element will keep track of this, even as the value changes: https:\/\/codepen.io\/chawes13\/pen\/gOZorqq (fired on blur).","@chawes13 wonderful, thank you for the video and the reproduction!\r\n\r\nAfter more investigation this is where I'm at on the issue:\r\n\r\n1. I was wrong in my original assessment. \r\n2. Ionic form controls are only compatible as controlled inputs today, meaning developers need to bind both `value` and `onIonChange` or `onIonInput`.\r\n3. Ionic should support `defaultValue` and `defaultChecked` on the appropriate form controls. Due to the nature of adding new API members and the implications these attributes have, I think we should track this as a feature request. \r\n4. This issue has likely the most impact in React environments, but does apply to the web standard, where a developer may want to compare if the value of a control is different than it's initial value. \r\n  a. The React type declarations could probably be modified to not mention that `defaultValue` and `defaultChecked` are React specific. This is a low priority.\r\n\r\nI created a dev-build for a prototype of these changes for `ion-input`, available with: `7.4.2-dev.11695324357.11675a9b`.\r\n\r\nForked reproduction with the dev-build: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/vxete3-qw7tav?file=package.json,src%2Fmain.tsx\r\n\r\nThe `defaultValue` and `defaultChecked` attributes need to [`reflect`](https:\/\/html.spec.whatwg.org\/multipage\/common-dom-interfaces.html#reflect) to `value` and `checked` respectively. For the input element (our `ion-input`) this is described in more detail within the [HTML spec](https:\/\/html.spec.whatwg.org\/multipage\/input.html#the-input-element).\r\n\r\nThanks again for the technical details to get this point.

The ionInfinite emitter will never be triggered.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect that the ion-infinite-scroll emitter to be called like normal when position is bottom.

That is why the distanceFromInfinite is not correctly determined. What we could do, is use the absolute value of the scrollTop value. When this is implemented bottom position will work when flex-direction: column-reverse is used.","comments":["Thank you for the issue. Can you give details on your use case for reversing the content's direction?","When creating a chat for example. We could have a footer where we put in a text and in the ion content we may only have messages. When the ion-content is reversed, the messages will also be shown reversed, also the scrollbar will automatically be at the end.","Thank you, that makes sense. I am able to replicate the described behavior, but it sounds like a better fit for your use case would be to use the `position` property of `ion-infinite-scroll` ([docs here](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/infinite-scroll#position)).\r\n\r\nOne way to accomplish this pattern would be to place the infinite scroll element at the top of the content, then wrap the chat items in a separate element and apply `flex-direction: column-reverse` to that instead. Here's an example showing a modified version of the first infinite scroll demo: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/angular-jfai5a-9p8rxx?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.css,src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.html\r\n\r\nCan you give that pattern a try and let me know if it works for your use case?","Thank you for checking. I won't be able to check this this weekend. Sorry for that, monday I can check if this works for my use case.","I have checked your solution. There are a few things that do not work as I expect.\r\n1. When I use an api there will be a delay when getting the initial value. To recreate this, in the ngOnInit we call this.generateItems() in a setTimeout. The problem that now arises is that the scrollbar will be at the top instead of the bottom.\r\n2. When scrolling to the top on my desktop, no new items will be added to the top. Only when I scroll down and up again the items are added. Video: https:\/\/recordit.co\/bSeBtqbqCq","For item 1, could you provide a Stackblitz link or Github repo demonstrating this? You can use another `setTimeout` or similar to add an artificial delay to `generateItems()` or wherever else the async action is normally performed.\r\n\r\nFor item 2, I was able to replicate that behavior by scrolling fast enough, but it also occurs with `position=\"bottom\"`. I'll either use this issue to track that or create a new one, depending on how item 1 goes. (There are also other existing issues that seem adjacent to that bug, but I need to dig into them further.)","Thank you for looking!\r\n1: I created an example using your fork -> https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/angular-jfai5a-cmuxus?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.css,src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.ts\r\n2: That sounds good","Apologies for the delay; I'm able to replicate item 1 but I'm still digging into what the best fix would be.\r\n\r\nFor item 2, we now have https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/18071 to track that, so I'll use this issue solely to track item 1.","Alright, so, the solution to item 1 is to call `ion-content`'s [`scrollToBottom` method](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/content#scrolltobottom) after the items have been initialized. I've created a new demo here: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/angular-jfai5a-wmvdyw?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.ts,src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.html,src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.css\r\n\r\nThere are a few notable pieces to this:\r\n1. `generateItems` has been updated to return a Promise, to bring the code closer to a real life scenario.\r\n2. `ngOnInit` now contains a `MutationObserver` which waits for the list to be fully hydrated before scrolling to the bottom. Otherwise, the list would have a height of 0, so the scroll wouldn't do anything. This part is only needed if the list items are `ion-item`s or other Ionic components; since you used `div`s in your examples, you may not need this.\r\n3. `scrollToBottom` is called at the bottom of `ngOnInit`, after `generateItems` has completed.\r\n\r\nCan you see if this pattern works for you? Let me know if you have any questions.","Thank you for further looking into the problem. It seems to work now. But it seems that there are two things that I don't like about this approach.\r\n1. The scrollToBottom is needed, this should not be necessary when using flex-direction: column-reverse.\r\n2. When scrolling up the items seem to flicker, that is probably related to the following code: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/infinite-scroll\/infinite-scroll.tsx#L155. This code is possibly not needed when using flex-direction: column-reverse? That is why I wanted to use the ion-infinite-scroll without position=\"top\".","Using `flex-direction: column-reverse` as in your original implementation is not feasible with `ion-infinite-scroll` because the `ionInfinite` event does not fire, as you originally reported. This is due to the `position` property being set to the wrong side, and `position=\"top\"` is required so that `ion-infinite-scroll` knows whether to perform the scroll correction you linked to in item 2. This scroll correction would be needed even if the `ionInfinite` event could be made to fire in your original implementation.\r\n\r\nAs for the flicker, we may be able to improve the experience there. I'll update this issue to track investigating that, and we'll let you know when we have more to share.","I know that the calculation of the position bottom is different from the top one. But I created a simple infinite scroll based on the Ionic infinite scroll code. What I noticed is that the calculation for the bottom position is fine when used with `flex-direction: column-reverse`. The problem is that the [scrolltop](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/infinite-scroll\/infinite-scroll.tsx#L113) is negative. It seems that scrolltop doesn't respond to negative values as read here: https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Element\/scrollTop. So, when I made the scrolltop value an absolute value by using the `Math.abs()` function it seems to work fine when using `flex-direction: column-reverse` with `position=\"bottom\"`. I don't really know if that is a good solution or not, I know that using `position=\"bottom\"` sounds weird, but in reality it is of course the bottom when everything is reversed.\r\n\r\nIf the flicker can be resolved that would also be great!"],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: Datetime active day does not clear when pressing cancel and re-opening","body":"### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nOn pressing default Cancel Button in ion-datetime with ion-datetime-button and opening the ion-datetime again the date that was canceled is preselected.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\non pressing the cancel button and opening the ion-datetime again should select the date that wasn't the one that was selected on cancel\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n```\r\n  <ion-datetime-button datetime=\"datetime\"><\/ion-datetime-button>\r\n\r\n  <ion-modal [keepContentsMounted]=\"true\">\r\n    <ng-template>\r\n      <ion-datetime id=\"datetime\"[showDefaultButtons]=\"true\"><\/ion-datetime>\r\n    <\/ng-template>\r\n  <\/ion-modal>\r\n```\r\n\r\n  use this and click the button and select a date and then press the cancel button \r\n  now click on the button again, the date selected will be one selected when we pressed cancel not the one that is in ion-daretime-button\r\n\r\nReproduction: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/angular-h94fr8?file=src%2Fapp%2Fexample.component.html\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Browser\r\n\r\nChrome \r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\n115.0.5790.170\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","comments":["Hello \ud83d\udc4b thanks for reporting this issue!\r\n\r\nI agree this behavior is confusing.

The problem I'm facing is that on the first load of the app, if the content of the tab performs `router.push('\/nested\/anyId')`, the back swipe of the nested page doesn't work. Interestingly, if I click on the `IonBackButton` in the header and then try to repeat the process, the back swipe does work for some reason.","Hi there, I wanted to ask if there are any updates on this side.

So, there\u2019s an `<IonBackButton>` with `defaultHref=\"\/feeds\"` and `text=\"Feeds\"`.\r\n\r\nThis works fine! However, the user has to manually press the back button to go back. They cannot swipe back to the feeds page since the feeds page isn\u2019t mounted in the DOM.\r\n\r\nOne thing I keep hearing from users it it would be cool if they could use a swipe back gesture instead of needing to manually press the back button. Because the user can swipe back everywhere else in the app, it\u2019s a little bit jarring when they cannot for this one page.\r\n\r\n### Describe Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been thinking of ways this could be cleanly implemented on Ionic\u2019s side with a nice clean API, and one idea I had is: What if `<IonBackButton>` had a `premountDefaultHrefIfNeeded` attribute?\r\n\r\nEssentially, when a page is loaded, if there is no page to swipe back to (e.g. `defaultHref` will be utilized when back is clicked) then the `defaultHref` page is premounted so that the user can swipe back to it.\r\n\r\n### Describe Alternatives\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been trying many different ways to do this without a library-side change, including loading `\/feeds` and then immediately redirecting to `\/feeds\/home` on load (works OKish, but many edge cases to deal with on a tabbed route setup and shows the page change animation on app start), and even tried using a `<Nav>` virtual page for the feed list (couldn\u2019t get it to work right).\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- Page could be premounted on `IonViewDidEnter` with the contents of `defaultHref` at that moment. This would ensure no animation performance issues.\r\n- If defaultHref is computed and defaultHref changes after `IonViewDidEnter`, it is ignored (since there is now a page in the history, defaultHref is no longer used)\r\n- In terms of HTML5 navigation, I think it should just replace the current route just like pressing the back button does.","comments":["Thanks for the report. The purpose of swipe to go back is to go back to a view the user was previously on. I think it would be confusing for a user to be able to swipe back to a view they were never on in the first place.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd recommend pushing the `\/feeds` route and then the `\/feeds\/home` route so you get both pages on the stack. The benefit of this is it results in the desired behavior, and users are aware that they were on `\/feeds` before being directed to `\/feeds\/home`.\r\n\r\nThis is the pattern that native iOS follows:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/2721089\/2d2df238-d250-47d3-a729-8b168e818deb\r\n\r\nIn the example above, rather than jumping directly to the \"Location\" view, iOS pushes the \"Privacy & Security\" view first so users can swipe to go back.\r\n","Yeah, that makes sense seeing the Settings example! This was something Apollo does but doesn't mean its necessarily the right behavior.\r\n\r\nJust checking - there's no way to push a route with no animation while allowing the swipe back animation to work, right?","You should be able to push without an animation: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/react\/navigation#useionrouter\r\n\r\nI believe if `routerDirection` is `none` then no animation will be played.","\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/2166114\/a891d1fa-f569-4649-935e-2b07b2e30d47\r\n\r\n@liamdebeasi I just found a use case where Apple App Store app allows swipe back to a page you were never on.

Part of the problem here is the description of `ionSwipe` is really vague. `ionSwipe` fires when the user has swiped on `ion-item-options` such that the options are fully revealed. This means that you need to essentially swipe past the boundary of the options to complete the gesture. Note that a partial swipe that still causes the options to be revealed does not cause `ionSwipe` to fire.\r\n\r\n> Options can be expanded to take up the full width of the item if you swipe past a certain point. This can be combined with the ionSwipe event on the [item options](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/item-options) to call a method when the item is fully swiped.\r\n\r\nThe documentation notes this to mean that you can use the `ionSwipe` event to know when that expandable option has been fully expanded (i.e. the expandable option is covering all the other options) so you can fire the callback for that option.\r\n\r\nHowever, the behavior where the expanded option snaps back is definitely not correct. Our current thinking is the expanded option should stay expanded on gesture-release, and `ionSwipe` should expose a method similar to the `complete` method on `ion-refresher` that lets the expanded option snap back to its initial state so it's not stuck covering the other options. This gives developers the option to either keep the option expanded or have it reset back to its initial state.\r\n","Going to mark this as a feature since we likely need to expose a new method to do this properly.","> Options can be expanded to take up the full width of the item...\r\n\r\nCould this be clarified in the docs?

Toasts in Ionic are intended to be subtle notifications that should not interrupt the user which is why we use `role=\"status\"`.

So I am, as I build out an app with Ionic, trying to find a more accessible solution. \n\nSnack bars, for the most part can:\n\n- Change state erratically\n- Disappear too quickly \n- Can obscure other items and are hard to spot\n- and can be inconsistent with where they are located\n\nI would prefer to use an `ion-toast` at the top of the screen for consistency. If I am logging notifications (which my app may do) and if I have an `alert` (which it will), I would like to have those options to do so. \n\nToasts and snack bars are very tricky when it comes to accessible experiences and getting them to conform to WCAG standards, but I\u2019d like to have that option, if possible, to do so.","Thanks for the additional information. My main concern about this feature request is it goes against how toasts are supposed to be used.

But I doubt that my customizations affects that.\r\n\r\n### Code Reproduction URL\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic6-angular13-ga1wv5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts\r\n\r\n### Ionic Info\r\n\r\nIonic 6 (ionic info not working in my monorepo)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n| Current | Shrink 0 |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n|![demo-current](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/c7f0b585-f1cb-4536-820a-f198df967e0a)|![demo-shrink-0](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/6a1228a1-e74a-4075-8185-b0bd138a9b9f)|\r\n| The icon is squeezed and size changed.

But this is just for demo reason. In my app I test with min width of 320px. But anyway...\r\n\r\nMaybe another issue but the buttons or its text should wrap.

For toasts with long text that cause elements to be squished, we would recommend using the stacked layout instead to maintain usability. You can see a demo with code examples here: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/v6\/api\/toast#layout Can you give that a try and let me know if it resolves your use case?","Thanks, but no. Ok, I missed the layout option and crafted my custom class to have that stacked flex column layout. But anyway... The problem is that the icon size depends on the parent, the button. Which is squeezed on smaller width\/screens. \r\n\r\n**Layout Stacked**\r\n\r\n| Original | Mod |\r\n|:-:|:-:|\r\n| ![demo-1](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/e7d61bf3-ab29-4258-b0c5-914902c7fbe6)|![demo-2](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/af5f9cc6-33b6-46d6-b0fb-db97837accea)|\r\n|![a](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/95f68ea6-6fa1-4f41-b7d8-32e80259ee27)|![b](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/668cb82e-115d-4ba5-b735-09bf89a9bd98)|\r\n| Close button is squished and icon shrinks. | Added `flex-shrink: 0` to the button fixes the icon size. |\r\n\r\nMy solution is just an idea. Maybe flex-shrink is not the best here. I think icon-only button should not shrink. For the other buttons it's ok and wanted to wrap text. I would also set break word to break on every character if there is no space. Otherwise the button will be overflow. This can be fixed with e.g. `word-break: break-word`. And the container can also set align-items: center ... maybe other issue.","Can you confirm whether the issue also occurs in the latest version of Ionic 7?","Maybe... See [demo](https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic6-angular13-sa2izm?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts). I see no icon. It seems we have another bug in Ionic 7 that icons are not displayed. \r\n\r\nBut yes... the icon-only button is squeezed in Ionic 7 too. So I'm sure the icon will shrink when it's showing.\r\nIt's all about icon-only buttons, which shouldn't be shrink.\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/60390085\/9f2d2fa8-ed47-45ca-a819-6c649149ec33)\r\n","Thank you!

The problem here is that we check for the existence of elements with attributes such as `slot=\"helper\"` inside `ion-item`. We do this using a `querySelector`: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/721fc6fd9a21c9c03bb21d290e9b1bbd703e43e3\/core\/src\/components\/item\/item.tsx#L218\r\n\r\n`querySelector` should return `null` if the element is not found, but in this case it is (incorrectly) returning `undefined`. Since we do a strict `!== null` check, the `hasHelperSlot` condition is `true`, and the warning logs. I will see if I can identify why this is returning `undefined`.","The root issue is with Domino, a library that Angular uses internally. Domino polyfills `Element.querySelector` in SSR. However, it incorrectly returns `undefined` instead of `null` when an element is not found. Since Ionic uses strict `null` checks, the deprecation warning is incorrectly being logged.\r\n\r\nI filed an issue with the Angular team: https:\/\/github.com\/angular\/angular\/issues\/51068","I'm also getting this issue.

This should resolve the issue reported here. However, the challenge is figuring out when to restore the relocated input. `relocateInput` works be creating a clone of the input (to avoid visual flickering) and then translating the original input up and off the screen so it is never covered by the keyboard. We then need to restore the relocated input so users can type: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/31c21f6aadb4261a977b962259f30509eae05edc\/core\/src\/utils\/input-shims\/hacks\/scroll-assist.ts#L157\r\n\r\nWe currently restore once scrolling has finished, but if there is no scrolling needed then we'll need to find the correct time to restore the input.","Hey, @liamdebeasi \r\n\r\nSo i've got it working.. Quick and dirty is the best I could come up with.. I thought I could create a good working solution but wasn't able to.. \r\n\r\nI started my research on the relocateInput, jsSetFocus and the other helper methods.. Wasn't being successful.. So, looking at the big picture, I wondered whether making sure the calculation was made and finding a way to apply the padding might make things work..\r\n\r\nHere's a main finding: Not so sure that adding a padding in the contentEl will work for modalSheets.. The sheet has the height of the full page, so there's no reason for the content to go up..\r\n\r\nThe solution i came up with is that first, when I detect that the input is inside a sheetModal (which I do by comparing contentEl.height and window.innerHeight), two things happen: \r\n1)  I modify the rect dimensions that are sent to getScrollData, so that the calculation of whether scroll is needed can be correctly made:\r\n    contentElRect.height -= contentElRect.top;\r\n    contentElRect.bottom = window.innerHeight;\r\n\r\n2) Since the contentEl padding won't work on a sheetModal, the \"padding\" (which in this case is a translate - more of that below), I modify the contentEl to which the --keyboard-offset is going to be applied.. I look for parentElements until I reach an ION-MODAL.  I use the ion-modal element as contentEl, to have the variable in a usable place.\r\n\r\nOn the component, I add a class to any modal that is a sheetModal:\r\n\r\n.modalSheetKeyboardPadding {\r\n  transition: transform 0.5s;\r\n  transform: translateY(calc(-1 * var(--keyboard-offset)));\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis moves the whole modal up..\r\nIt works..\r\n\r\nNot ideal, since there's a transparent space below the modal..\r\nBut I just couldn't find out a way to work with the translate: matrix that moves the sheetModal between the breakpoints.. I was trying to add a calc( -1 * var(--keyboard-offset) + ${currentValue}) to the Y value, but just wasn't able to figure it out.. \r\n\r\nI found the moveSheetToBreakpoing method and did: \r\n      wrapperAnimation.keyframes([\r\n        { offset: 0, transform: `translateY(calc( -1 * var(--keyboard-offset) + ${breakpointOffset * 100}%))` },\r\n        { offset: 1, transform: `translateY(calc( -1 * var(--keyboard-offset) + ${(1 - snapToBreakpoint) * 100}%))` },\r\n      ]);\r\n\r\nAnd it kind of works during the transitions.. But no luck when the animation ends, as expected.. just couldn't find out how the translate:matrix that places the sheetModal on the desired breakpoint comes to be..\r\n\r\nHopefully this might help with a proper fix?\r\n\r\nI'd guess:\r\n - Proper detection of the input being in a sheetModal and calculating location based on the sheetModal location\r\n - Adding the keyboard-offset to the \"content\" part of the modal to go along with the breakpoint transform\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to help if there's something else that may be useful..\r\n\r\nAnd please let me know if you see something that I could be breaking that I should test?\r\n\r\nHere's the patch that got it working:\r\n\r\n````\r\ndiff --git a\/node_modules\/@ionic\/core\/dist\/esm\/input-shims-c7404a50.js b\/node_modules\/@ionic\/core\/dist\/esm\/input-shims-c7404a50.js\r\nindex 5766072..2bda6c9 100644\r\n--- a\/node_modules\/@ionic\/core\/dist\/esm\/input-shims-c7404a50.js\r\n+++ b\/node_modules\/@ionic\/core\/dist\/esm\/input-shims-c7404a50.js\r\n@@ -152,10 +152,10 @@ const enableInputBlurring = () => {\r\n };\r\n \r\n const SCROLL_ASSIST_SPEED = 0.3;\r\n-const getScrollData = (componentEl, contentEl, keyboardHeight) => {\r\n+const getScrollData = (componentEl, contentElRect, keyboardHeight) => {\r\n   var _a;\r\n   const itemEl = (_a = componentEl.closest('ion-item,[ion-item]')) !== null && _a !== void 0 ? _a : componentEl;\r\n-  return calcScrollData(itemEl.getBoundingClientRect(), contentEl.getBoundingClientRect(), keyboardHeight, componentEl.ownerDocument.defaultView.innerHeight \/\/ TODO(FW-2832): type\r\n+  return calcScrollData(itemEl.getBoundingClientRect(), contentElRect, keyboardHeight, componentEl.ownerDocument.defaultView.innerHeight \/\/ TODO(FW-2832): type\r\n   );\r\n };\r\n const calcScrollData = (inputRect, contentRect, keyboardHeight, platformHeight) => {\r\n@@ -208,6 +208,7 @@ const PADDING_TIMER_KEY = '$ionPaddingTimer';\r\n  *\/\r\n const setScrollPadding = (contentEl, paddingAmount, clearCallback) => {\r\n   const timer = contentEl[PADDING_TIMER_KEY];\r\n+  \/\/ console.log(paddingAmount,timer);\r\n   if (timer) {\r\n     clearTimeout(timer);\r\n   }\r\n@@ -220,7 +221,7 @@ const setScrollPadding = (contentEl, paddingAmount, clearCallback) => {\r\n       if (clearCallback) {\r\n         clearCallback();\r\n       }\r\n-    }, 120);\r\n+    }, 500);\r\n   }\r\n };\r\n \/**\r\n@@ -298,7 +299,28 @@ const jsSetFocus = async (componentEl, inputEl, contentEl, footerEl, keyboardHei\r\n   if (!contentEl && !footerEl) {\r\n     return;\r\n   }\r\n-  const scrollData = getScrollData(componentEl, (contentEl || footerEl), keyboardHeight);\r\n+  let contentElRect=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify((contentEl || footerEl).getBoundingClientRect()));\r\n+  \/\/ console.log('testing',contentElRect.height - window.innerHeight<20, contentElRect.top > 50);\r\n+  if (Math.abs(contentElRect.height - window.innerHeight)<20){\r\n+    let parent=contentEl.parentElement;\r\n+    let i=0;\r\n+    while(parent.nodeName != 'ION-MODAL' && i<100) {\r\n+      parent = parent.parentElement;\r\n+    }\r\n+    if (parent.nodeName == 'ION-MODAL') {\r\n+      let currentOffset=parseInt(getComputedStyle(componentEl).getPropertyValue('--keyboard-offset').replace('px',''));\r\n+      contentElRect.height -= contentElRect.top - (currentOffset || 0);\r\n+      contentElRect.top += (currentOffset || 0);\r\n+      contentElRect.bottom = window.innerHeight;\r\n+      contentEl = parent;\r\n+      \/\/ console.log('juegue',contentElRect.height,contentElRect.bottom,contentElRect.top,window.innerHeight);\r\n+    } else {\r\n+      console.warn('scrollAssist sheetModal fix detonated on wrong place!');\r\n+      debugger;\r\n+    }\r\n+  }\r\n+\r\n+  const scrollData = getScrollData(componentEl, contentElRect, keyboardHeight);\r\n   if (contentEl && Math.abs(scrollData.scrollAmount) < 4) {\r\n     \/\/ the text input is in a safe position that doesn't\r\n     \/\/ require it to be scrolled into view, just set focus now\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing is that the 120milisecs wasn't giving the process enough time to cancel the timeout, so switching between inputs removed the keyboard-offset..

Have you tried calling `relocateInput` in this if-block? https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/32bc33ed28fc29ea9d6104520c370fa316606e00\/core\/src\/utils\/input-shims\/hacks\/scroll-assist.ts#L93-L111","Hey @liamdebeasi \r\n\r\nAfter hammering on it, it turns out the problem I believe may be somewhere else..\r\n\r\nThe relocation of the input is working alright on sheetModals..\r\nThe problem seems to be that the input is relocated inside the sheet modal and iOS only recognizes the sheetModal space as valid, and therefore, even though it's relocated to -9999px, iOS places it at top of the sheetModal and auto-scrolls..\r\n\r\nThe conceptual solution I've come up with is that I'll clone the entire sheetModal and move the sheetModal up (and hide it with scale(0))..\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm writing is because maybe this sparks some ideas you could share with me..\r\n\r\nWill come back later with what I find out..\r\n\r\nBTW... This final conclusion comes after quite some debugging, testing, lot's of console logging (because I've found it hard to debug this kind of things with devTools because the debugging of scrolling behavior becomes tricky - unless I'm missing something)\r\nThe final test was that if I grow the sheetModal tall enough for the input to be in a \"safe-no-auto-scroll-needed-according-to-iOS-safari\", the native autoscroll stops.. \r\nI've ruled out the auto addition of scroll-y class to the sheetModal starting at the 0.7 breakpoint as well as other stuff I right now can't remember..","Here again @liamdebeasi \r\n\r\nOk.. So here's a \"working\" workaround..\r\n\r\nThe situation is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1) Adding a padding to the bottom of ion-content doesn't work (the current mechanismo of scroll_assist).. The sheetModal.. has to be moved up..\r\n I implemented a transform: translateY on the ion-modal element, but has the problem that it leaves below empty space.. I think changing the breakpoint and only after that adding a padding to the content if needed would be better, but that's way above my capacity.. \r\n What I did was add a class that implements the translateY using the same --keyboard-offset variable.\r\n The --keyboard-offset variable has to be added to the ion-modal, not to the ion-content element.  That is implemented by searching  for a modalSheet in the sheetModalDetection function in input-shims. That replaces contentEl.\r\n\r\n2) The relocation logic was working well, but the thing is that moving the input inside the sheetModal wasn't enough, because iOS wasn't caring about the screen location of the input but rather of the maximum top of the container, which is the sheetModal, and which most of the time is below the \"safe-input-location-so-dont-autoscroll\" location of iOS safari..\r\n I'm duplicating the whole sheetModal instead of only the input, and moving it upward and to the left.  \r\n There's an extremely weird situation that has to do with having to have a transition effect on the modal or else it doesn't work.  I'm guessing it has to do with the sheetModal having some transitions because of it being a sheetModal.. I stumbled into the implemented solution by pure accident..\r\n\r\nHere's the patch to input-shims:\r\n````\r\ndiff --git a\/node_modules\/@ionic\/core\/dist\/esm\/input-shims-c7404a50.js

The `.native-wrapper` would also need: `position: relative` to contain the element positioning.\r\n\r\nHere is an example concept with manually modifying the DOM and adjusting styling:\r\n\r\n<video src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/13732623\/233706299-e8eedf24-1e6b-47c5-9d45-35f3a7017a6d.mp4\"><\/video>\r\n\r\n`ion-select` isn't as straight forward. The control does not fill the entire container space. I need to do additional investigation on our decision behind these styles, as I don't see the same thing against: https:\/\/material-components.github.io\/material-components-web-catalog\/#\/component\/select.\r\n\r\nA mock API could look like:\r\n```html\r\n<ion-input label=\"Name\" label-placement=\"fixed\" highlight=\"control\"><\/ion-input>\r\n```\r\nIt would support two options `full` and `control`, defaulting to `full`.\r\n\r\nI'll discuss with the team and see if there are alternatives that I may be missing or any questions around the feature's feasibility. \r\n","Thinking through the border aspect specifically, we could do something similar to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n\/* user land styles - border is always visible *\/\r\nion-input {\r\n  --border-width: 1px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe helper\/error text styling could be refactored to something similar to this, when active:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n\/* input.scss *\/\r\n:host(.has-helper-text), :host(.has-error-text) {\r\n --border-width: 1px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, the `.input-wrapper` styles could be refactored to make use of the border styles, applying the border on the bottom instead of the helper\/error text applying a border top:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n\/* input.scss *\/\r\n.input-wrapper {\r\n  border-bottom: var(--border-width) var(--border-style) var(--border-color);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow the default implementation to apply the border style\/color when the helper\/error text is used, but developers could optionally override and apply the border at any time through the `--border-width`, `--border-style` and `--border-color` CSS variables. \r\n\r\nI am going to move this request into a labeled feature request.

The root cause is [`delegatesFocus`](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/ShadowRoot\/delegatesFocus) being set on `ion-accordion`.\r\n- #25064\r\n  This issue sounds like it's also caused by `delegatesFocus`\r\n- #25529\r\n  Also some different behavior from Firefox in relation `delegatesFocus`, although I'm not sure if related.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it works in Firefox is that clicking inside the content area of the accordion doesn't set the focus to the header `ion-item`. On Chrome\/Edge, it will focus the header (although it doesn't receive the focus styling, so this isn't immediately obvious).\r\n\r\nThis means that clicking into the content area and then pressing spacebar does nothing on Firefox, but it will close the accordion on Chrome. It also means that pressing Shift+Tab will focus the header on Firefox, but it will focus the _previous_ accordion on Chrome.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, I don't think clicking inside the content area of an accordion should focus the header. On mobile devices (or mobile emulation in the Chrome dev tools) this also has the effect of scrolling the header of the accordion to the center of the screen when first tapping inside it (as mentioned in #25064, but this works with any non-focusable content in general. See third accordion in the Stackblitz example).\r\n\r\nOn another note, it seems like a bug with the spec and\/or Chrome\/Safari implementation that it's impossible to select text inside a shadow element with `delegatesFocus`. At least on the second tap, when the an element inside the shadow root already has focus, clicking in a non-focusable area of the same shadow element doesn't cause the focus to change.  \r\nYou can test this with the second accordion in the Stackblitz. Focus one of the inputs, then clicking the text above doesn't change focus, yet it still prevents you from selecting text.  \r\nBut that's not something Ionic can fix.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the only solution would be to not use `delegatesFocus`. I don't know what intended behaviors depend on `delegatesFocus` being true and if they can be achieved another way. The keyboard navigation seems to depend on it, and that is currently broken on Firefox due to its incomplete implementation of the `delegatesFocus` spec.","comments":["Thanks for the report.

So far, so good. However, this only works correctly sometimes, and other times it does not. For example, we have a page like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ion-header>\r\n  <ion-toolbar>\r\n    <ion-buttons slot=\"start\">\r\n      <ion-back-button defaultHref=\"\/dashboard\/home\"><\/ion-back-button>\r\n    <\/ion-buttons>\r\n  <\/ion-toolbar>\r\n<\/ion-header>\r\n\r\n<ion-content fullscreen>My Cool Content<\/ion-content>\r\n\r\n<ion-footer class=\"ion-no-border\">\r\n  <ion-toolbar style=\"min-height: initial; padding: 24px 24px 0 24px;\">\r\n    <p>Bla Bla Bla<\/p>\r\n  <\/ion-toolbar>\r\n  <ion-toolbar style=\"padding: 24px;\">\r\n    <button style=\"height: 86px;\">Save<\/button>\r\n  <\/ion-toolbar>\r\n<\/ion-footer>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we assign a background image to our ion-content, the error in the incorrect offset calculation is very noticeable. When the appload event is fired again (`window.dispatchEvent(new Event('appload'));`) afterward, ion-content will correct the offsets, and they will be accurate. See in this video:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/4930169\/226323071-38292ef3-e6fb-4197-8c05-400125f6313e.mp4\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBy subsequently firing `window.dispatchEvent(new Event('appload'));` with a timeout, there is a brief flickering, as the user briefly sees the black area. I would wish that in any case, ion-content always determines the correct offset values by itself and automatically.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused right now... I have exactly the same structure of my app in StackBlitz, and the error does not occur there. Could this possibly have something to do with timings?

There was an error with my push - sincerest apologies Liam! I've put up a fresh repo - should be up there now whenever you have a chance to pull from https:\/\/github.com\/drakedeatonuk\/ionic-issue \r\n","Thanks. I can reproduce the reported behavior, but this does not appear to be a bug in Ionic. The iOS page transition works by translating elements within `ion-toolbar`, not the header or the toolbar component itself. So the entering view is placed on top of the leaving view, but the `.toolbar-background` element in `ion-toolbar` begins offscreen and transitions in.\r\n\r\nYour code sets the background color of `ion-header` and `ion-footer`  which does not translate. As a result, the red bars appear because the header and footer elements are placed on screen. I recommend removing `background: red` from `ion-header` and `ion-footer`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your code sets `background: red` on `ion-toolbar`. Since the `ion-toolbar` element itself does not move, red bars appear on the screen as well. To test this, try setting `--background: red` on `ion-toolbar`. This will set the background color of `.toolbar-background` instead of `ion-toolbar`. You will need to remove `color=\"primary\"` though since that takes precedence over the inline styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHere is what the transition should look like now:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/2721089\/218176668-7fb8ef64-9119-414b-8168-ce9ce39ba971.mov\r\n\r\nYou will also notice a black area on the leaving view. This is happening because the leaving view does not have a header\/toolbar. I recommend adding a header with a toolbar to avoid this.","Thanks @liamdebeasi for your masterful insight into the inner workings of this transition. This issue has plagued me for much, much longer than I care to admit!\r\n\r\nI hadn't realised the implications of using custom background styles on the `ion-header` & `ion-toolbar` elements. Perhaps a warning about this in the docs could be useful, just a thought.\r\n\r\nI've implemented your advice and the transition has indeed improved but is still somewhat out of sync. This behaviour may or may not be a bug but I'll explain what I'm encountering below:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. the black background on the leaving view\r\n\r\nI tried adding your recommendation of adding an `ion-header` to the leaving view but the black bar is still present as is visible in this video:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/41165256\/218249857-2917bcc3-03f1-465d-a6ee-319d9aa69a80.mov\r\n\r\nFYI - I did find that setting the background-color of the `ion-app` element \"removed\/filled-in\" that black space, however it still left behind a faint vertical line as can be seen in this clip:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/41165256\/218250236-960b40a1-d70f-4030-867b-18ae37f17102.mov\r\n\r\nPerhaps the faint line is a shadow? It's hard for me to identify what the CSS is and\/if which element it belongs to during the transition!\r\n\r\n### 2. entering view ion-header is out of sync with ion-content & ion-header\r\n \r\nConsider the below image, wherein the header is visually out of sync with the rest of the view content during the transition:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"325\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 09 24 49\" src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/41165256\/218250820-6fe0ed88-0a56-41e7-9221-2c5da9f24ef5.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this has something to do with how the  `.toolbar-background` element is transitioning? Is this a bug or is there a working solution to fix this?\r\n\r\n### 3. entering view ion-header is missing a left shadow\r\n\r\nThis can also be seen in the previous screenshoot, in which both the `ion-content` & `ion-footer` elements have a left shadow on them as they transition, but the `ion-header` does not have a shadow.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or is there similarly something I'm missing here?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've pushed a new commit to the repository which demonstrates all these issues - could you have a look? \ud83d\ude4f ","Thanks, this one does appear to be a bug. The iOS page transition creates a \"shared toolbar\" effect where the entering and leaving toolbar items appear to translate across a single toolbar background. However, this effect only works when both the leaving and entering views have toolbars. Our transition currently does not consider the use case where only 1 view has toolbars. This is causing the issue reported in https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/26736#issuecomment-1426677719.\r\n\r\nNote that in this case the Tab 1 page _does_ have a toolbar, but when playing the transition the entire Tabs context is considered the view because we need to animate the tabbar too. The Tabs view in your application does not use a toolbar, so the iOS transition should not attempt to create a shared toolbar effect.\r\n\r\nA couple other things to note:\r\n\r\n1. This is more easily seen in your app because you removed the dark mode theme but kept `<meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"light dark\" \/>` in your app. This causes system controls (such as the body\/scrollbars) to react to dark mode changes. Even though your app runs in light mode, if your phone is in dark mode the background will appear black. Removing this meta tag should make the issue less noticeable.\r\n\r\n3. Using the translucency effect on headers should mask this issue pretty well (and is likely why we are only catching this now). The translucency effect causes the background to get blurred: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/header#translucent-header\r\n","Thanks mate, added in these fixes and the issue is no longer noticeable "],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"feat: Add row-gap\/column-gap (gutters) to ion-grid\/ion-row","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\r\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already include this feature request, without success.\r\n\r\n### Describe the Feature Request\r\n\r\n`ion-grid` and related components don't provide an easy way to add space between items, something commonly found in other frameworks that have a layout grid, such as Bootstrap.

I definitely agree that this feature would be valuable for Ionic. The reason we haven't already added it is because `ion-grid` uses flexbox, and browser support for the `gap` property there isn't up to what we need right now: https:\/\/caniuse.com\/flexbox-gap (Compare with our support table here: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/reference\/browser-support#desktop-browsers) There may be a custom solution, like using margins or CSS grid, but it may take a bit of an overhaul.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I would suggest using CSS grid and its `gap` property as an alternative.","It would be helpful for now, for `ion-col` to be refactored to make it easy for custom CSS to target. and know about the current intended column size.

This will require no additional APIs and will be a better developer experience.\r\n\r\n","Hey @sean-perkins, is someone working on this issue?\r\n","@Hussain0520 this issue is not currently in the active sprint work. This would likely be a post v7 bug fix, unless there was a community contribution in the interim. ","I would like to contribute to this issue but as this is my first contribution a little help from your side would be much appreciated!","We have a contributing guide listed here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nThe only section that may be outdated is tests, which are now written with Playwright.\r\n\r\nFrom the `core\/` directory:\r\n```\r\nnpm install \r\n```\r\n\r\nInstalling the browser images:\r\n```\r\nnpx install playwright\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting a component:\r\n```\r\nnpx playwright test src\/components\/nav-link\/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue stems from here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/nav-link\/nav-link.tsx#L34-L36\r\n\r\nYou would need to debug if the event target allows you to see if the clicked element is a disabled button\/link or not and if it is disabled, not executing the `navLink` utility. Otherwise we need to experiment with the best way to query the interactive element from inside `ion-nav-link` and add the click listener directly to that element. ","Can you assign me this issue as it will help me in college project. I am looking forward to work in resolving this issue. Thanks!","@sean-perkins can you assign me this issue?\r\n","How to resolve this issue now? In the documentation there is no clear instruction how to avoid a navigation at all.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<IonNavLink routerDirection='forward' component={someFunction}>...<\/IonNavLink>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe tried with `undefined` and `null` and it still navigates to some blank page. How to prevent, with a function, to navigate at all? Also in the component function, there is no event where we could stop propagation or anything.\r\n\r\nI think there need to be two fixes. One for the disabled and one for the function return. Current workaround looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    continueIsDisabled &&\r\n    <IonButton disabled={true}>Continue<\/IonButton>\r\n}\r\n{\r\n    continueIsDisabled === false &&\r\n    <IonNavLink routerDirection='forward' component={someFunction}>\r\n        <IonButton>Continue<\/IonButton>\r\n    <\/IonNavLink>\r\n}\r\n```","it's a little annoying but i am just conditionally rendering the nav link or else a separate disabled button. it's indistinguishable from a ui perspective","Here is a dev-build with the proposed fix for checking for the disabled button when clicking the `ion-nav-link`. If anyone would like to test and let me know if they run into any issues that would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n```\r\n7.3.3-dev.11693454416.1cb6a7ec\r\n```\r\n","@sean-perkins The fix in the dev-build works great for me.

Why does adding a button not work in this case?","Adding a button kinda \"would work\", but if we take the undo toast as an example: Normally i would have a text like \"undo\" and the click function to the whole toast.

I think there is a way we can support this with just a button. The `message` prop is optional, yet the message container is still rendered. If we do not render the message container if it is not set (and make a few smaller tweaks), we should be able to get the desired result. A few things we need to adjust here:\r\n\r\n1. Do not render `.toast-content` if the message is not set.\r\n2. Find a better way of setting the margin-end on the `.toast-button-group` (or remove it altogether).\r\n3. Users will need to set `--width: fit-content` on `ion-toast` to have the wrapper snap to fit the button as opposed to being full width.","Wouldn't it be easier then to just add a click handler? \ud83e\udd14 This would also give the advantage that it would work with header and message for example","The wrapper element itself is not a button, so it should not be clickable.

The issue appears to be that when going back to Tab 3 for the second time, the browser is wiping the history. The reason for this is when you go back to Tab 2 (you should be on the Tab 2 child page) and press the `ion-back-button`, we call `router.go()` to go back to the previous instance of Tab 2. When you tap Tab 3, we push a new `\/tabs\/tab3\/view` route which causes the browser to clear its routing history.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe big limiting factor here is that the browser history wants linear navigation. Mobile tabs are non-linear by nature as each tab is its individual stack.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following flow:\r\n\r\n\/tabs\/tab2 --> \/tabs\/tab2\/view --> \/tabs\/tab3 (tap the Tab 3 button) --> \/tabs\/tab3\/view --> \/tabs\/tab2\/view (tapping the Tab 2 button again).\r\n\r\nIf you press the `ion-back-button` you should go back to `\/tabs\/tab2`. This is what happens right now.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you press the hardware back button multiple times on an Android device, you should be taken backwards through the following flow:\r\n\r\n\/tabs\/tab3\/view --> \/tabs\/tab3 --> \/tabs\/tab2. Note that going from \/tabs\/tab3 brings you to \/tabs\/tab2 not \/tabs\/tab2\/view. The reason for this is we already popped \/tabs\/tab2\/view off the Tab 2 stack. This does not happen due to the issue I noted above.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBoth the issue you noted and the hardware back button issue stem from how we push new routes when switching between tabs. I have a few ideas for how we can solve this, so I am going to talk with the team and see which option is best.","The `ion-back-button` issue reproduces in Ionic Vue, but the hardware back button issue reproduces across Ionic Angular, Ionic React, and Ionic Vue.\r\n\r\nI tested this using the [Ionic React Conference App](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-react-conference-app) and the [Ionic Angular Conference App](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-conference-app).","Hey @liamdebeasi thanks for the explanation, undestood! \r\n\r\nPleased we've got it logged as I've had to rework my app to use ion-nav and pushing views onto its own stack but I'd of course prefer to be able to use the router.\r\n\r\n","Quick update: We need to fix https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/25255 and https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/24594 before we can fix this issue. \r\n\r\nWe have a fix in place for https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/25255, and it is currently being reviewed by the team.

It didn't match any `IonRouter` definition I've seen so I looked it up. It turns out, if I understand [this comment](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/vue-router\/src\/router.ts#L238) correctly, that this issue has already been solved, it's just not been fully integrated.\r\n\r\nThis is what I ended up doing to fix the issue:\r\n_(Keep in mind that I don't really know what I'm doing and my project is still rather small so, unforeseen issues might arise.

Regular `ion-item`s also don't trigger it.\r\n- Clicking the button first causes it to be focused, so when you click the item, focus instead moves to the `ion-item-option`.\r\n- I tried just having an `ion-button` with the `ion-list` below it, no accordion, and focus instead moved to the `<body>`.

Presenting a new sheet modal when the state changes. Functional, but the transition between dismissing the previous sheet modal and presenting the new sheet modal is noticeable and not ideal.\r\n2. Dynamically changing the height of the modal. Displays similarly, but does not transition between height changes. Also the gesture behavior responds incorrectly.\n\n### Related Code\n\nSupporting this internally will require changes similar to: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/commit\/f08456700246e7b14ef9eb2354bfdd9499a76d74\r\n\r\nWe will need to safeguard against instances where:\r\n- The current breakpoint is no longer in the list of available breakpoints \r\n- The sheet gesture needs to be re-created as a result of the breakpoints being modified \n\n### Additional Information\n\nDuplicate feature request as: #24752, with updated use case.","comments":["And if it is possible to add an event for each change of breakpoitn.

I\u2019ve decided to redirect the user based on a context value and prevent from falling into any unmatched route.\r\n\r\nHere is how I declared that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\r\n\r\n    <IonApp>\r\n\r\n      <IonReactRouter>\r\n\r\n        <IonSplitPane contentId=\"main\">\r\n\r\n          {isLoggedIn && <Menu \/>}\r\n\r\n          <IonRouterOutlet id=\"main\">\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/home\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Home \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/payment-history\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <PaymentHistory \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/renewal\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Packages \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/session-result\/:type\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <SessionResult \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/treatment-plan\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <TreatmentPlan \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/profile\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Profile \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/cancellation-policy\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <CancellationPolicy \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/terms-and-conditions\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <TermsAndConditions \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/help\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Help \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/notifications\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Notifications \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/getting-started\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <GettingStarted \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/progress-report\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Progress \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/policies\" render={() => isLoggedIn ? <Policies \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route path=\"\/login\" render={() => !isLoggedIn ? <Authentication \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/home\" \/>} exact={true} \/>\r\n\r\n            <Route render={() => !isLoggedIn ? <Redirect to={'\/login'} \/> : <Redirect to={'\/home'} \/>} \/>\r\n\r\n            {\/* <Redirect to={ !isLoggedIn ?

I've updated the title and see the same behavior on my end. We will capture this as a bug and prioritize in an upcoming sprint. ","Any progress on that?","I have cloned and updated all the dependencies to check if it's resolved but i can still see flickering without even doing any thing. @sean-perkins ","It's been an year now. Do you guys have any update regarding this? @sean-perkins @liamdebeasi ","@ashish-yourphysio this is still an open issue in our backlog. The team has worked on many issues in the past year.

Additional debugging insight into the problematic code or a fix to the issue would be appreciated by both the team and the community. \r\n\r\nI understand this issue may be extremely critical to your application, but we are small team that tries to solve the largest sum problems across Ionic Framework (web components, Angular, React and Vue), Ionic docs (documentation and live examples) and the Stencil Framework Wrappers for DX for frameworks consuming our web components.\r\n\r\nWe have improvements for routing in design, but it is unclear if they would have an immediate impact to this specific issue, without identifying the root cause to the transition flickering with the fallback route defined. ","I can confirm that the problem still exists.\r\nIf the page starts and there is a redirect that occurs than the transitions are flickering, here is a stackblitz - you can see in App.tsx that there are comments, regarding the redirects.\r\nOnly \"open\" redirect causes flickering (btw only if you start the app from \"\/\", if you refresh at \"\/customer\/tabs\/home\" then everything works fine)\r\nThe commented Redirects together gets the same result but no flickering occurs, even if you start the page from \"\/\".\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/aexcxb?file=src%2FApp.tsx (to

Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already report this problem, without success.\n\n### Ionic Framework Version\n\n- [ ] v4.x\n- [ ] v5.x\n- [X] v6.x\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen an `ion-card-content` immediately follows an `ion-card-header`, its `padding-top` is removed to avoid excess vertical space between the header text and content (via CSS in [card-content.md.scss](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/card-content\/card-content.md.scss#L48) and [card-content.ios.scss](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/card-content\/card-content.ios.scss#L45)).\r\n\r\nThis works well if both have the same background colour, but when one of them has its `Color` property set, the lack of padding between the content text and the coloured background looks wrong:\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/1843264\/154475834-8a880940-cbe5-41b3-aa06-e1a7fde24c62.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally, leave the default padding if the background colour of the header and content are different:\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/1843264\/154476373-4d82307d-af70-4b90-a3f3-0020cae7925f.png)\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, it would probably be acceptable if, say, the padding is only cleared if the header does not have its `color` attribute set, e.g.\r\n\r\n``` css\r\nion-card-header:not([color]) + .card-content-ios {\r\n  padding-top: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a simple page with the following HTML:\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<ion-content>\r\n\t<ion-card>\r\n\t\t<ion-card-header [color]=\"danger\">\r\n\t\t\t<ion-card-title>Something Is Rotten<\/ion-card-title>\r\n\t\t<\/ion-card-header>\r\n\t\t<ion-card-content>\r\n\t\t\t...in the state of

Can you provide some information surrounding the desire to have `ion-item` elements be that small? Our components are designed for mobile + tablet device screens with `ion-item` intended to take up the entire width of the screen. This particular behavior only happens around ~280px in width, which is smaller than many device screens that we support. ","@DwieDima Thanks, I forgot. Slot \"end\" prevents the value from being hidden. But take a look to the [demo](https:\/\/codepen.io\/infacto\/pen\/wvPPemm). The label and end slots are both flex and share space 50\/50%. Which results in unused \/ weird space. Label cut off or wrapped for no reason apparent to the user. I already tried some css hacks. But found nothing satisfying. Maybe because native input can't have inline width. I just wonder, why it works without setting slot. Maybe I have to invest more time. Or I redesign the inputs. e.g. using appearance with floating labels. Or change flex ratio. Anyway, slot end is not the solution. The issue here can still occur.\r\n![demo](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/60390085\/154238240-c3801e1f-6c61-46ef-a06c-1e2d43692a9c.gif)\r\n\r\n@liamdebeasi I also test screens down to a minimum of 320 pixels.

I like option 2 with using the `*`. It seems the most consistent given what we currently offer in Ionic.","Possibly related is the ability to use wildcards to match multiple levels of segments.\r\n\r\nFor example: `<ion-route url=\"*\" component=\"page-404\" \/>`\r\n\r\nCurrently using `<ion-route url=\"\/:any\" component=\"page-404\" \/>` matches `\/a` but not `\/a\/b`.","> Currently using `<ion-route url=\"\/:any\" component=\"page-404\" \/>` matches `\/a` but not `\/a\/b`.\r\n\r\nAre you sure about this ? I thought it  would match [1] and `any` would be the first segment only i.e. `a` (adding to the confusion).\r\n\r\nBut yes the idea with `*` would be to match anything not matched by other routes (whatever the number of segments).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/router\/test\/matching.spec.tsx#L78","Sorry about that - you are correct.  It matches `\/a\/b` but the `b` value is lost.  It does not match '\/'.\r\n\r\nThe issue I ran into in the past was trying to match optional trailing  segments.\r\n\r\nFor example `<ion-route url=\"\/mypage\/:any\" component=\"my-page\" \/>`\r\n- does not match `\/mypage`\r\n- does not match `\/mypage\/`\r\n- matches `\/mypage\/a` as {any: 'a'}\r\n- matches `\/mypage\/a\/b` as {any: 'a'} but does not think that the route was changed so the page is not rendered again and there is no way to access \"b\"\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to use something like `<ion-route url=\"\/mypage\/*\" component=\"my-page\" \/>` to match all of the url values and have some way to get the full matching path.","I'm not sure about this usage of *. You probably want to have some kind of structure for your urls. This would permit anything.\r\n\r\nBut anyway I think it's outside of the scope of this issue.\r\n\r\nI do agree that the fact that you can add any number of extra segments after the URL without impacting matching is weird (and you can't do that if your last ion-route had its url set to \"\/\")\r\n\r\nedit:\r\n\r\n> but does not think that the route was changed so the page is not rendered again and there is no way to access \"b\"\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that even if we could match anything at the end there still would not be a route change when navigating from '\/mypage\/a' to `\/mypage\/a\/b`. One way to solve this could be to watch the property `any` but I think it is a missing part of the current router because you would want to know when all the parameters have been set (There could be multiple parameters (`\/:any1\/:any2`) and for all the route branch.

Can you please explain why this behavior does not work for your use case?","You are right, I have been looking at other apps and this is not a bug.\r\n\r\nI propose a new parameter to choose if you want to slide the content and slide the modal only from the header, or slide the modal without considering the content as it currently is.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have a map, with some items in the modal. Clicking on the item moves the map to the coordinates of the item. If I have the modal at 100% the movement is not seen, if I have the modal for example at 40%, I can't scroll through the list of items.","Thanks! It sounds like in this case you want a swipeable modal that does not take up 100% of the screen. Would setting `--height: 40%` on the `ion-modal` work instead?\r\n\r\nMy concern is adding this functionality would make swiping up harder as it would limit where you can swipe to just the header. Additionally, if you chose not to use a header users would not be able to swipe at all. This is something the card-style modal does, but we are looking to change that since it has been a pain point for some.","Yes, I had also thought of it as a solution, but in that case you could not put the modal at 100% of the screen, and it greatly limits the content you can see. In my example it's not that useful, but there may be other cases where you need 40% scrolling content as well as 100%.","Thanks.

Ideally it would align with Apple's native behavior, in which a swipe within modal content starts by scrolling, until we reach the top of scrollable content, at which point it turns into a drag action on the entire sheet and ultimately a dismissal if swiped to the bottom of the screen. Or, in fewer words: You can scroll and dismiss in the same gesture.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I thought I'd share a workaround that I cobbled together from this thread and some SO sources. This doesn't provide what I just described\u2014a swipe only scrolls, it can't drag or dismiss (unless you target the drag handle, in which case it's not a scroll). Basically I declare the breakpoint to be `1`, making it scrollable, and then offset the positioning by a bit to make the background visible.\r\n\r\nIn my global scss file:\r\n```scss\r\n\/**\r\nHOW TO USE:\r\n* Give your modal `[initialBreakpoint]=\"1\"` and `[breakpoints]=\"[0, 1]\"`. If you include other breakpoints\r\nin the array, scrolling will not work on them. By calling the breakpoint 1, ionic provides the scrolling.\r\n* Give your modal class `scrollable-sheet-modal-95`. This will take up 95% of the screen height. Rather\r\nthan hardcode this, the mixin below parses the \"-95\" suffix.\r\n* If you'd like a different percentage, duplicate the \"@include\" line below with a new argument and use\r\na corresponding class, e.g. `@include custom-sheet-modal-height(90)` and `sfd-scrollable-sheet-modal-90`.\r\nYou can't just use any suffix you want in the class; there has to be a matching \"@include\".\r\n* But if you want a much lower height, maybe question why you're making it scrollable rather than making\r\nit bigger.\r\n*\/\r\n@mixin custom-sheet-modal-height($argument) {\r\n  $heightString: $argument;\r\n\r\n  &-#{$heightString}::part(content) {\r\n    height: unquote($argument + '%');\r\n    bottom: unquote('-' + (100 - $argument) \/ 2 + '%');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nion-modal.scrollable-sheet-modal {\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  @include custom-sheet-modal-height(95);\r\n  \/\/ Add similar lines here to use other heights.

I see what you mean now.

Your fix definitely does help, that is wrapping the Modal's content inside a IonContent.

You can set modal height to 75vh, then use a max breakpoint of 1. Modal will not expand above this threshold. Gesture to close as discussed still needs to be fixed along with the \"delay\"","Thanks for the extra details, folks. I'm able to replicate all issues mentioned, and in core, meaning they likely happen in all frameworks. To summarize:\r\n\r\n1. Once the modal is fully opened, there is a noticeable delay before content becomes scrollable. ([screencast](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/150804485-ff0addfd-ad27-4ed4-b9fd-fdd70200fc63.mp4))\r\n2. Once you can scroll, dragging down on anywhere but the handle when the content is scrolled to the top doesn't do anything, when it should move the modal. ([screencast](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/150804832-e6b281f9-b2b2-48a3-a94a-5d79e4665ed3.mp4))\r\n3. The sheet modal usage examples need updating with example HTML for the modal, and a note about using `ion-content` to ensure things are scrollable.\r\n4. When the max breakpoint is not 1, and the modal is fully opened, it can still be dragged up higher before snapping back down. (Workaround mentioned above: set `--height: 75vh` on the `ion-modal`,  or whatever height you need, and use a max breakpoint of 1.) ([screencast](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/150805998-b8729b9a-3f09-41bd-8dee-b752e6bdd36b.mp4))\r\n5. For the above scenario, scrolling on mobile is very difficult, since most of your gestures drag the modal around instead. This is a slightly separate issue from 4 as it happens in both directions -- if you're scrolled down, and drag down, the modal will usually move when this should scroll the content up instead. ([screencast](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/150806796-c914ad6c-d12c-468a-b59c-2f17021b23e2.mp4))\r\n6. I found this one while investigating: for modals with a max breakpoint of less than 1, the bottom of the content is cut off and can't be scrolled to. ([screencast](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/150807141-10303286-1046-47d9-9c3f-1f648f3659db.mp4)) The `--height: 75vh` workaround works here too.","@amandaesmith3 Great [article](https:\/\/blog.ionicframework.com\/announcing-ionic-v6-1\/)!

For the problem you described, is that something you would expect Ionic to handle automatically? If so, it might be better to address that issue rather than add an API to workaround the behavior.","Thanks for taking a look at my issue.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if Ionic should do this automatically. There are multiple things in the way of getting the background(s) and refresher working together the way our design calls for.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to use the `--background` custom property, it looks like the background shadow part doesn't know the height of the scrolling content. Its height ends up as 100% of the window and doesn't \/ can't scroll. And using `background-attachment` settings don't do anything because of this, and\/or because the background and content are in separate places.\r\n\r\nIf I use css to put a background on `&::part(scroll)` I can get the bg to scroll with the content, though the background will also move down when everything is pulled down with the refresher causing the unwanted separation between header and content background images. The scroll content is aware if its own height here, so I can use it if needed.\r\n\r\nI can use css to put a background on `ion-content` (not using the custom property). Setting its position to absolute keeps it at the top when pulling down. I guess this works because it's separate from the background and scroll parts.\r\n\r\nIf I hack these last two together, I can almost get things working. There's just a minor edge case when deciding to reverse the pull down.\r\n\r\nThere are also layering issues because when I am able to keep the background at the top during a pull down, the refresher is behind the background. So, this still requires some `z-index` tweaking to keep the refresher above the background and below the scrolling content.\r\n\r\nI was playing around with [`setCss()`](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/refresher\/refresher.tsx#L690-L698) which manipulates the y of the scroll area along with the background. If you take out the background stuff here, it stays at the top when pulling down. You could have a property on the refresher that tells the bg to stay at the top and you'd check if that's set here. But that would just be a different API change. And you'd still have to deal with layering issues, along with telling the bg the height of the content so it can scroll up.\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, the collapsable header is used between the header and the content so keeping the bg of the content stationary in that scenario wouldn't work. I don't need that to work, I'm just bringing up another complication.\r\n\r\nIt seems that having backgrounds in the header and at the top of the content that match up with one another isn't a standard use case.","I made a [brief video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/616S6wnZ-VI) which explains my issue and addresses whether Ionic should handle this behavior automatically.","Thanks for the detailed explanations!

partially visible element causes entire view to scroll","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\r\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already report this problem, without success.\r\n\r\n### Ionic Framework Version\r\n\r\n- [ ] v4.x\r\n- [X] v5.x\r\n- [X] v6.x\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nOn chromium browsers, when using tabs, focusing an element that is partially visible will makes the browser to attempt to scroll so that the focused element is fully visible on the screen (to my knowledge, this is a feature that only exists on chromium browsers).\r\n\r\nBut because the `.inner-scroll` part of the `<ion-content>` component is bigger than the `<ion-content>` itself due to negative positioning and additional padding:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.inner-scroll {\r\n  top: calc(var(--offset-top) * -1);\r\n  bottom: calc(var(--offset-bottom) * -1);\r\n  padding-top: calc(var(--padding-top) + var(--offset-top));\r\n  padding-bottom: calc(var(--padding-bottom) + var(--keyboard-offset) + var(--offset-bottom));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the browser thinks that content that are partially visible (relative to the `<ion-content>`) are alreay visible within the `.inner-scroll`, therefore, the browser will attempt to scroll other element of the interface to make the element fully visible instead of scrolling the `.inner-scroll` (and yes, the browser is able to scroll element that are not even scrollable, i.e: `overflow: hidden`).\r\n\r\nIn my case, the browser is scrolling the closest `.ion-page` parent of the `<ion-content>`, this makes the entire app move up, making the `<ion-header>` no longer accessible and creating empty space below the `<ion-content>`.\r\n\r\nYou can see this by executing this command in the browser's console:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndocument.querySelector('ion-content').closest('.ion-page').scrollTop;\r\n\/\/ Should outputs 0, but outputs 56 after the browser has made the focused element fully visible\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis outputs the exact same value as the negative positioning, in my case, the `.ion-page` (which is not even scrollable) has been scrolled by 56px.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe browser should not scroll the parent `.ion-page` and should scroll the `.inner-scroll` instead.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I see to this, is not to make the `.inner-scroll` bounding box bigger than the one of the `<ion-content>`.\r\nIs there a reason it has been made like this in the first place ?\r\n\r\nYou will see on the video I have uploaded, that I can fix this by applying the `padding` value to the `margin` instead.\r\nIn my case:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nion-content::part(scroll) {\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 56px 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this could also be solved with:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nion-content::part(scroll) {\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    bottom: 0;\r\n    padding: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich entirely remove the need of the negative positioning, but these solutions may have side effects that I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create an app with an `<ion-tabs>` and `<ion-content>`\r\n- Add several elements that are focusable inside of it, so that the `<ion-content>` become scrollable\r\n- Make it so you have a focusable element partially visible on your screen (it works best if you have big element like in my video)\r\n- Click the partilly visible element to focus it (it only works if you focus a non focused element, as the browser does not attempt to scroll to make it fully visible when it is already focused)\r\n\r\nYou'll see that the browser has scrolled the parent `.ion-page` instead of the `.inner-scroll`.\r\n\r\n### Code Reproduction URL\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Julien-Marcou\/ionic-focus-scroll-bug\r\n\r\n- npm install\r\n- ng serve\r\n- open with chrome (don't scroll the viewport)\r\n- toggle mobile device toolbar\r\n- use a resolution of 360px wide by 740px tall (the bug is reproducible with any resolutions, but my reproduction repo makes it easier to see at this resolution)\r\n- click on the 4th button (don't scroll before clicking it, the button should only by partialy visible before clicking it)\r\n- see how the content has been scrolled so the 4th button is now fully visible and how the header is no longer visible\r\n\r\n### Ionic Info\r\n\r\n@ionic\/cli :

Resulting in content that is not \"visible\" to the user (even though in our case it doesn't matter, because there is actually nothing to see in the content that is behind the `<ion-toolbar>` & `<ion-tab-bar>`).\r\n\r\nSo, because the `<ion-content>` has overflowing content, it is considered as \"scrollable\" by the browser, even though it is not scrollable by the user (until you explicitly add the rule `ion-content { overflow: auto; }`, which we do not want as the `.ion-scroll` element is here for that).\r\n\r\nThen when you click an element that is partially visible within a \"scrollable\" element, the browser will attempt to bring it into the \"visible part of the viewport\" so it is fully visible.\r\n\r\nIn our case the browser scrolls the `.ion-page`, although it could scroll the `.ion-scroll` viewport to achieve the same result, but the browser doesn't know it, it scrolls from the root of the document until the focused element is reached or the focused element is considered visible.\r\n\r\nWhich results in Chrome scrolling the `.ion-page` instead of the `.ion-scroll` element.\r\n\r\nAt this point I don't see any other solutions than the ones I suggested above.\r\nThe reason I don't open a Pull Request, is because I don't understand this negative positioning, IMO we could totally remove the `padding-top` & `padding-bottom` rules, and replace the negative positioning with `top: 0` & `bottom: 0`, but may be there is some reasons behind it that I don't understand, may be for scrolling effects when you reach the bottom\/top of the viewport, or for the sticky `<ion-header>` that changes on iOS when you start scrolling ?\r\n\r\nHopefully this will help you understand the problem ^^","Although this is a feature of Chromium browsers, I don't entirely agree on the `external` label ^^\r\n\r\nIMO, the problem lies in a \"bad layouting\" from Ionic (between the `<ion-tabs>` & the `<ion-content>`), using negative values to make the `.inner-scroll` (`<ion-content>`'s viewport) bigger than the `.tabs-inner` (space allocated by the `<ion-tabs>` for its content)  isn't good practice.\r\n\r\nThe `top` negative value is needed in order to make the translucent effect on iOS:\r\nBecause the `<ion-header>` is not part of the viewport, by \"expanding\" the viewport up with a negative value it makes it appear under the `<ion-header`> to simulate a `position: sticky;` on the `<ion-header>`. \r\n\r\nAlthough this would require some breaking changes, it would definitely be cleaner to have the `<ion-header>` be part of the viewport and be sticky, instead of simulating this with negative values (also, on desktop, it would have the benefit to make the scrollbar fully visible, instead of hidding it behind the `<ion-header>`).\r\n\r\nAs for the `bottom` negative value, I have no clue why it's here, I don't see any translucent effect on the `<ion-tab-bar>` so it seems totally unnecessary (I might be wrong, but I haven't found anything yet).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor people who may have encountered this issue, only removing the `bottom` negative value is enought to fix this issue and it doesn't seem to add any side effect.\r\n\r\nThis is because even though Chromium browsers are able to scroll non-scrollable elements like the `.ion-page`, it still can't scroll to negative value, and because every element has by default a scroll position of 0, it can only go in one direction at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is what I did to fix the problem:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n\/* inside your global.scss *\/\r\nion-content::part(scroll),\r\nion-content::part(background) {\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  padding-bottom: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","> As for the bottom negative value, I have no clue why it's here, I don't see any translucent effect on the <ion-tab-bar> so it seems totally unnecessary (I might be wrong, but I haven't found anything yet). \r\n\r\nThat is a known bug: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/17676\r\n\r\n> Although this would require some breaking changes, it would definitely be cleaner to have the <ion-header> be part of the viewport and be sticky, instead of simulating this with negative values (also, on desktop, it would have the benefit to make the scrollbar fully visible, instead of hidding it behind the <ion-header>).\r\n\r\nWhile this change likely would give us the same \"fullscreen\" effect, it would extend to Android devices and users who do not want the fullscreen effect, so I am not sure that would be a good change to make.","There may be some new CSS features we can use to get the desired effect (with content scrolling under the header) without the top\/bottom hacks. Probably worth some investigation on our end.","> That is a known bug: #17676\r\n\r\nOh, ok, that make senses now \ud83d\ude05, so to do what I just said, it would also require to make the `<ion-tab-bar>` be part of the viewport.\r\n\r\n> While this change likely would give us the same \"fullscreen\" effect, it would extend to Android devices and users who do not want the fullscreen effect, so I am not sure that would be a good change to make.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure to understand, the \"fullscreen\" effect is already present on Android device at the moment, the viewport takes the entire screen's size, but the top & bottom parts of it are hidden behind the `<ion-header>` & the `<ion-tab-bar>` ; making these 2 elements be part of the viewport and sticky would give the same result (as scrollbars are not visible on mobile devices anyway), am I wrong ?\r\n\r\n(I agree this would need quite a lot of changes, which may not be conceivable at the moment)","The main issue is that the header\/footer would become part of the scrollable content.

If I were to build my application for Electron, it would suffer the same problem ^^","@csaar95\r\n\r\n1. That's to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe first time you click the element, it is not yet focused (it's not the document's active element), so focusing it will make the WebView scroll to make it fully visible, but the second time you click it, it is already focused (because Ionic focuses it after the action sheet has been closed), so re-clicking doesn't make WebView scroll again. What makes the scrolling on the dismiss is not directly the WebView itself, but the `focus()` call made by Ionic when dismissing the overlay (as shown in https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/25496#issuecomment-1159396893).\r\n\r\nIn short, the WebView only scrolls when the element gain the focus (not when clicking it), to my knowledge, this can't be disabled with any CSS, it can only be disabled when the focus is programmatically made with `element.focus();` (by writting `element.focus({preventScroll: true});`)\r\n\r\n2.

Once the suspense resolves and the `IonContent` is mounted, the animation then works correctly. This is not an issue for pages that do not have a footer, since the entire suspense wrapper could be wrapped with an `IonContent` as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<IonContent>    \r\n    <React.Suspense fallback={<IonLoading isOpen={true} \/>}>\r\n        {RandomComponent ? <User1 \/> : <User2 \/>}\r\n    <\/React.Suspense>\r\n<\/IonContent>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue then arises when you have a page that has an `IonFooter` since this sits outside the `IonContent` wrapper so you cannot wrap the suspended component in an `IonContent`.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this problem in more detail please check out this demonstration:\r\nhttps:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/nostalgic-platform-qfwqv\r\n\r\n### Describe Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nPreferably, there would be a component which is able to wrap the `IonContent` and `IonFooter` so that the entire page content can be suspended and lazy-loaded such as the solution below:\r\n\r\nPage.tsx\r\n```\r\nconst PageContent = React.lazy(() => (import('.\/PageContent')))\r\n\r\nfunction Page {\r\n    return (\r\n        <IonPage>\r\n            <IonHeader>\r\n                ...\r\n            <\/IonHeader>\r\n            <NEWCONTENTWRAPPER>\r\n                <React.Suspense fallback={<IonLoading isOpen={true} \/>}>\r\n                     {<PageContent \/> }\r\n                <\/React.Suspense>\r\n            <\/NEWCONTENTWRAPPER>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPageContent.tsx\r\n```\r\n<>\r\n    <IonContent>\r\n        ...\r\n    <\/IonContent>\r\n    <IonFooter>\r\n        ...\r\n    <\/IonFooter>\r\n<\/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am open to any other alternatives you have to solve this issue.\r\n\r\n### Describe Alternatives\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","comments":["Thanks for the request. Could you try wrapping your `IonLoading` component in another `IonContent` and see if that solves your issue?\r\n```\r\n<React.Suspense fallback={<IonContent><IonLoading isOpen={true} \/><\/IonContent>}>\r\n  {GetDataAndDecideWhichComponentToRender ? <State1 \/> : <State2 \/>}\r\n<\/React.Suspense>\r\n```","@amandaesmith3 thank you for the response. We initially tried this approach but we ran into issues where the suspense would resolve during the page transition animation resulting in a glitching effect, especially on iOS. This demonstrates the issue in more detail: https:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/elated-surf-ydlpf\r\n\r\nDoing this also introduces a glitch on ios when the parent page uses a [collapsable large title](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/title#collapsible-large-titles). If you directly route to a nested page and then click the back button to go back to the parent page (e.g. \/user\/user1 > \/user), the title animation seems to break.\r\n","For the suspense resolving during the animation, this is technically working as intended (the async process finishes before the transition, and the `IonLoading` component only shows for that long), but I think we can smooth it out a little. I'll work on it and let you know when I have more to share. For a workaround in the meantime, you could try adding `showBackdrop={false}` to the `IonLoading` to reduce the flicker somewhat.\r\n\r\nAs for the collapsible large title issue, could you provide steps to reproduce? I'm unable to reproduce in my end; here's a recording showing what I'm doing along with the code I added to your example: https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/90629384\/144481423-5acdb77d-45d7-4a76-9594-0922acc03d45.mp4 ","If you go to the **\/users\/1** route directly (i.e. refresh the page on **\/users\/1**) and then press the back button, you then get transitioned back to the **\/users** route as expected, however, if you watch the title animation you can see it go below where it is supposed to sit and then suddenly jump back up to the correct position.","I'm still unable to reproduce; could you perhaps give a recording showing the behavior you're seeing, along with the code needed?","Does this thread mean that Ionic 6 is working correctly with Suspense and there is nothing to fix?","> Does this thread mean that Ionic 6 is working correctly with Suspense and there is nothing to fix?\r\n\r\nTechnically, yes, but the visual effect from the original poster's example [here](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/24292#issuecomment-984753634) could be smoothed out a little from Ionic's side. Namely, we could stand to wait for the page transition to finish before dismissing the `ion-loading` component, which would reduce the visual flicker.\r\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and change this ticket to cover that update. In the meantime, @milanharia if you are still having trouble with the title animation, could you file a separate issue with its own code reproduction?","Hello,\r\n\r\nAny update on this issue?\r\n\r\nWe are also running into this, using a simple IonSpinner to indicate loading of a lazy sub page with suspense, but when the page code (bundle) is ready, the spinner disappears and the old page reappears and the new page is fading in. This looks very bad. It should not show the old page but directly show the new one. Is there any way that we can let Ionic know about being inside Suspense setup and thus adapt the fading in?\r\n"],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"feat: Add Material Design 3 (Material You) support","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\r\n- [x] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already include this feature request, without success.\r\n\r\n### Describe the Feature Request\r\n\r\nRecently, the new [Material Design 3](https:\/\/m3.material.io\/) (publicly known as _Material You_) Guidelines were released. They are quite a cut compared to the current [Material Design 2](https:\/\/m2.material.io\/), but are now considered the new standard on newer Android devices (Android 12+). Google is also updating all their apps to conform their new specs. Can we expect the Ionic Framework to support the new look and feel for Android devices, and if so, are there already any plans with which release we can expect it? Personally, I think Material You is a great improvement over MD2 and it would be nice if we could ship our apps with this new and awesome design as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nGuidelines: [https:\/\/m3.material.io\/](https:\/\/m3.material.io\/)\r\n\r\n### Describe the Use Case\r\n\r\nAs an Android 12+ user I want all my apps to fit into the new design ecosystem created by Google.\r\n\r\n### Describe Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if the Material You Design is an opt-in feature that developers can toggle themselves (for example during start up time dynamically or compiled into the final bundle). An exemplary configuration is listed below:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\r\n  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot({\r\n    mode: 'ios' | 'md' | 'md3'\r\n  }), AppRoutingModule],\r\n  providers: [{provide: RouteReuseStrategy, useClass: IonicRouteStrategy}],\r\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: It's been a few years since the creation of this issue and the Angular ecosystem has changed quite a bit. So here is a second exemplary configuration for standalone components:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { provideIonicAngular } from '@ionic\/angular\/standalone';\r\n\r\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...,\r\n    provideIonicAngular({\r\n      mode: 'md3'\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe Alternatives\r\n\r\nProvide some helper tools (for example using the CLI or some web tool) that automatically generates a CSS file based on a given primary color that overrides the default Ionic styles to match with the Material You Design Guidelines. Google themselves already created a tool like this for the web for native Android applications: [https:\/\/material-foundation.github.io\/material-theme-builder\/](https:\/\/material-foundation.github.io\/material-theme-builder\/)\r\n\r\n### Related Code\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","comments":["@danielkleebinder thanks for the thorough write up and links to supporting documentation. \r\n\r\nIn our short term, our big focus internally is releasing Ionic 6 and all the supporting material around it (blog posts, docs, issues, etc.). \r\n\r\nAligning our components to native design standards has always been a continuous goal and Material You will likely fit into a new release of Ionic in the future. \r\n\r\nIf everyone could upvote this issue (\ud83d\udc4d ) to help let us know it's important to you and your app development efforts, that'd be great! \r\n\r\n","Hello my friends, if you need MATERIAL DESIGN 3 how about https:\/\/www.beercss.com?\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_4](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/12979016\/188708647-119ebc69-b1a4-41f4-8518-a5de7b1b2ed9.png)","Whilst that's a really nice library, I haven't been able to make it work (maybe because my level).

I've personally added Material Design 3 to some of my projects by simply following the [specifications](https:\/\/m3.material.io\/components) and adding global CSS that implements these and overrides existing styles on components such as `ion-tab-bar`, for example. This is sufficient for most of my use cases for now.\r\n\r\nFar more difficult to implement, in my opinion, are the new motion and transition guidelines. Especially morphing animations (as you can observe [here](https:\/\/m3.material.io\/styles\/motion\/overview)) are something I cannot invest time into because of their increased complexity. Even Google themselves are [not planning to add motion support for their web implementations](https:\/\/m3.material.io\/styles\/motion\/overview). On the other hand, animations like that directly guide the user from application state A to application state B which improves usability; also they simply look great.\r\n\r\nAre transitions, animations and motions planned for a potential MD3 implementation in Ionic?","I think we can use HTML and CSS's new page motion feature, but I'm not sure about that feature to work with the router.","Hi everyone.

The community can help us by voicing which features are the most important to your applications _now_ versus features we may be able to postpone or not do at all. \r\n\r\n@danielkleebinder transitions, animations and motions would be supported through a few of the interactions that are demonstrated on their site. Mainly the page-to-page router transitions (push\/pop) and the side menu effect. I am unsure about the shared element transitions between page-to-page, as that is a fairly complex implementation detail for a framework to create, that would work for all instances of how a developer's UI may be constructed. Likely in that scenario we would need to investigate if there is an API that could be exposed to enable developers an easier implementation of their own custom experience. \r\n\r\n","@sean-perkins Sure.\r\nThe most used components that I've seen differences:\r\n\r\n- Global The colors and their variations are more subtle.

I'm able to reproduce your issue. \r\n\r\nThis appears to be a flaw in how we proxy outputs events from our web components into Angular's outputs\/observables. Making use of `fromEvent` is causing Angular Language Service to take the type signature of `addEventListener` instead of our custom type declarations for our events.\r\n\r\nYou can temporarily avoid this error by disabling strict templates in your `tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"angularCompilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"strictTemplates\": false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nalternatively you can type cast to satisfy the compiler:\r\n```ts\r\ndoReorder(ev: Event) {\r\n  const customEvent = ev as CustomEvent<ItemReorderEventDetail>;\r\n  \/\/ replace ev usages with customEvent\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll post back when we discover a better approach for those generated proxies. ","Hello @JumBay and @EbenDang, happy Friday!\r\n\r\nI wanted to share that we have a resolution in the works (#24314) and are committed to resolve this issue. Unfortunately this resolution results in a breaking change for a less common pattern of event binding. We are getting very close to our Ionic 6 release and don't want to introduce a breaking change this close to release.\r\n\r\nWe will be following up after Ionic 6 is released to evaluate the full impact of #24314 and explore any changes that could result in a minor change.","Great, Thanks","Temporary solution if you want to leave strict template type checking enabled is to wrap `$event` in `$any()`.  Example:\r\n\r\nTS:\r\n```TypeScript\r\n  doReorder(ev: CustomEvent<ItemReorderEventDetail>) {\r\n    console.log('Dragged from index', ev.detail.from, 'to', ev.detail.to);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTemplate:\r\n```HTML\r\n<ion-reorder-group (ionItemReorder)=\"doReorder($any($event))\" disabled=\"true\">\r\n```","Hello everyone! I'm very excited to share a dev-build that I believe resolves this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6.1.11-dev.11655500065.1d345d4c\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any testing and confirmation with that build. It takes advantage of our new type declarations available through Stencil and an Angular workaround (hack) to offer compatibility with the Angular Language Service without emitting duplicate events. \r\n\r\nIn the OP's scenario, you may need to use the new event types to get full compatability:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { ItemReorderEventDetail, IonReorderGroupCustomEvent } from '@ionic\/core';\r\n\r\ndoReorder(ev: IonReorderGroupCustomEvent<ItemReorderEventDetail>) {\r\n \/\/ existing code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAreas I would explicitly like confirmation on:\r\n1. Angular Language Service (type checking in your IDE) no longer errors\/throws exceptions\r\n2. No build errors in your application\r\n3. Events are emitted as expected (no duplicate events)\r\n4. Application functions correctly for local development and in a production build \r\n\r\nI will continue to do more testing in my world after the long weekend, but am super excited to finally get this issue resolved.\r\n\r\nThanks!","@sean-perkins is the fix part of `v6.1.11` release?","@hakimio no, the PR to address this issue is still in a draft state: #25502.\r\n\r\nWith the changes required to resolve the issue, I'm giving the community plenty of time to test with the dev-build and help verify, before merging and releasing. ","Any update on this?","@sean-perkins `v7` is going to be released soon. Any plans to incorporate fix for this issue in `v7`?","@hakimio I'm hopeful that we can find a sustainable solution in the v7.x.x release, but it will not be included in the v7.0.0 release. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution that I had found resolves this specific issue, was leveraging private APIs that the Angular team advised we do not use (high risk of the component wrappers breaking during a minor version of Angular). We have plans to coordinate our requirements with the Angular team, to collaborate on a solution together. Stencil, Lit, Vanilla WC and other WC solutions all have a similar need to be compatible within an Angular project (or at least have a good developer experience).

We are already working on a backwards compat layer for React Router v5 users and will be testing it with several customers soon. Our plan is to develop a similar layer for Reach Router users as well. If you have a large app and upgrading to v6 seems daunting, don't worry. Our backwards compat layer is on the way. Also, v5 will continue to receive updates into the foreseeable future, so don't rush it.\"\n\n### Describe Preferred Solution\n\n`@ionic\/react-router` should update to React Router 6.\n\n### Describe Alternatives\n\nContinue to use React Router 5 and make use of the backwards compatibility layer described in the blog post.  However, from a long-term perspective, I worry about bugs with this approach: having Ionic control React Router though a BC layer could increase the difficulty of debugging.\n\n### Related Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIt would be awesome to hear the Ionic team's thoughts on a timeline for this.  Could it be in a minor version update after v6 releases, or will it have to wait for v7?","comments":["I also have this question. \r\nNow that we have Ionic version 6, i was trying to upgrade to react router version 6 as well, but it seems not yet possible.\r\n\r\nI get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n.\/node_modules\/@ionic\/react-router\/dist\/index.esm.js\r\nAttempted import error: 'withRouter' is not exported from 'react-router-dom'\r\n```\r\n","@fortesp This is a feature request, not a bug report.

This, combined with the Iconic team being Angular developers, is my guess that there is a complete lack of progress here. \r\n\r\nSSR routing and the trend in web development are entirely different from mobile stack and tab navigation. Most of these libraries rely on the browser's built-in history. Some new mobile navigation features are even coming built-in to the browser, making it even less urgent for these teams to invest time.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\n### 1. Create a universal Ionic Router\r\n\r\nThis is really what the Ionic team should do. They already built a stack\/tab navigation for Angular. It works better in all regards. The best thing to do is optimize it so that the core route management is agostic to any UI platform. Just really a state machine for routing. Then, build interface layers for Angular, Vue, and React. The community could then expand upon that. \r\n\r\n### 2. Bail on Ionic for routing: Framework7\r\n\r\nI have not used it in production. However, I will say that https:\/\/framework7.io\/ had a much better router in place for React.\r\nOf course, if you end up using that router, you could use the entire framework for UI. \r\n\r\nThe guy who maintains it also has a tailwind version, https:\/\/konstaui.com\/, which is pretty cool. However, the core Framework7 is more maintained. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind, Framework7 and similar libs work with Capictor just fine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"],"labels":["type: feature request","package: react"]},{"title":"bug: Ionic React routerDirection \"none\" causes BackButton to go to defaultHref","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/.github\/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-an-issue).\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/code-of-conduct).\r\n- [X] I have searched for [existing issues](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues) that already report this problem, without success.\r\n\r\n### Ionic Framework Version\r\n\r\n- [ ] v4.x\r\n- [X] v5.x\r\n- [ ] v6.x\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nI think based on my understanding of the `routerDirection` prop, I think this may be a bug-\r\n\r\nWhen routing via Item, Button, etc with `routerLink` and `routerDirection` if `routerDirection` is set to \"none\" the back button on the routed to page goes to the `defaultHref` instead of the page you came from. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/14936212\/137333122-58991d36-1226-410a-b52f-85be66c35d5d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBackButton should use history to determine where to go back to, even with \"none\" as `routerDirection`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nExample REPO\r\n\r\nFrom Tab 1 - \r\nButton 1 routes as default with a forward direction and then you go back to Tab 1. \r\nButton 2 routed with direction \"none\" and will then take you back to Tab 2 (the `defaultHref` for the Back Button)\r\n\r\n### Code Reproduction URL\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/babycourageous\/ionic-router-direction-none-bug\r\n\r\n### Ionic Info\r\n\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI       : 6.17.1 (\/Users\/renedellefont\/.fnm\/node-versions\/v14.17.6\/installation\/lib\/node_modules\/@ionic\/cli)\r\n   Ionic Framework : @ionic\/react 5.8.4\r\n\r\nCapacitor:\r\n\r\n   Capacitor CLI      : 3.2.5\r\n   @capacitor\/android : not installed\r\n   @capacitor\/core    : 3.2.5\r\n   @capacitor\/ios     : not installed\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res : not installed globally\r\n   native-run  : 1.5.0\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v14.17.6 (\/Users\/renedellefont\/.fnm\/node-versions\/v14.17.6\/installation\/bin\/node)\r\n   npm    : 6.14.15\r\n   OS     : macOS Big Sur\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behavior I can PR to the docs to perhaps clarify that section.

I am going to close this as this is not a bug in Ionic Framework. The problem here is that the `ion-modal` still has a backdrop even when using the sheet modal. Clicking the backdrop dismisses the modal by default. Given that your initial breakpoint is `0.05`, the backdrop will have an opacity of `5%` making it hard to see.\r\n\r\nFor this use case, you can use the `backdrop-breakpoint` property which determines the point after which the backdrop will become active. Setting `:backdrop-breakpoint=\"0.05\"` means that the backdrop will begin to fade in starting at offset `0.06`.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found on the v6 docs: https:\/\/beta.ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/modal#sheet-modal","Hello @liamdebeasi, thanks for the help!\r\n\r\nYour note solved the problem of disappearing the ion-modal, but I still have the same problem in the ion-menu, I can't drag to close.

We need to adjust this code: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/menu\/menu.tsx#L371\r\n\r\nCurrently, the menu gesture will not activate if there is an open modal. This is to prevent a swipe gesture on a modal from opening the menu underneath. However, with a partially opened sheet modal being able to open the menu may be a desired behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it looks like the menu gesture listens on `document` which might also cause some issues here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/menu\/menu.tsx#L194\r\n\r\nChanging the listening element from `document` to something more specific may remove the need for https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/core\/src\/components\/menu\/menu.tsx#L371, potentially allowing this to work without any additional effort.","Perfect @liamdebeasi, thanks for your efforts.\r\n\r\nI really don't understand and I don't have enough knowledge to resolve this issue, internally.

Went removing it again and having no fallback routes in the app at the moment (which might be fine for a mobile app, but definitely not fine for a web SPA). Will have to revisit this","@thomasklemm using `<Switch>` instead of `<IonRouterOutlet>` means there will be no transitions between pages.\r\n\r\nIt's shocking the Ionic team hasn't even responded to this bug in the router since it was raised in 2018.\r\n\r\nBump","Just ran into this issue in 6.19.1. **useIonViewWillLeave and useIonViewDidLeave also stop working**.\r\nAnother workaround for web pages, if you don't mind a refresh :\r\n`<Redirect to={() => {window.location.replace(REF); return <AnyComponent \/>;} \/>\r\n\/\/ where REF is a valid url`\r\n\r\nPlease look into this, Ionic Team !","Is this framework dead or what?","Any updates on this? \ud83d\udc40 \r\n\r\nWe just ran into this on 7.2.2 in these two scenarios:\r\n1. Redirect from `\/login` to `\/home` page\u00a0when user is logged in \u2013\u00a0after the redirect our params on Home page would come up as `undefined`.\r\n2. When handling a default 404 route. If user then goes to Home page by clicking the Home link, the params on Home page come up as `undefined`.\r\n\r\nIn both cases a refresh would result in params being loaded properly, so it's something specific to redirect and\/or the use of the default route.\r\n\r\nWe can confirm that the `<Switch><\/Switch,` hack from [this message](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/23743#issuecomment-1018248547) does solve the problem, but as [said above](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/23743#issuecomment-1066536960) \u2013 this impacts transitions between pages.","This happens not only for `<Redirect>` but for any `<Route>` without the `path` param. The issue is somewhere in Ionic StackManager. Looks like it incorrectly calculates the previous view in some cases.\r\n\r\nE.g. with the following routes:\r\n```\r\n<Route path=\"\/home\/:someParam\"><Home \/><\/Route>\r\n<Route><NotFound \/><\/Route>\r\n```\r\nIf we start from any \"not found\" URL and then navigate to `\/home` the Ionic StackManager will calculate[ `enteringViewItem`](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/StackManager.tsx#L93C11-L93C28) the same as was rendered for NotFound component and [will replace the entering Route element](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/StackManager.tsx#L116) but will leave all other props as is including `computedMatch` values which are empty. \r\nThis is caused by the following line: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/6d4c52aa5bbafd390056eb57a9151c55f9788c17\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/ReactRouterViewStack.tsx#L127 but this behaviour can't be disabled otherwise routes without `path` params will not work. \r\n\r\nI think this one also related https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/26524\r\n\r\n`Switch` from ReactRouter always recalculated `computedMatch` this is why it works as a workaround. But in this case, the component tree will affected and some features from the Ionic Router will break (e.g. transitions and life-circle hooks). Route component from React Router [can recalculate `match` values if `computedMatch` is not provided](https:\/\/github.com\/remix-run\/react-router\/blob\/v5\/packages\/react-router\/modules\/Route.js#L41). So the better workaround will be to remove [`computedMatch` calculations](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/ReactRouterViewStack.tsx#L70):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Route as ReactRouterRoute} from 'react-router'\r\n\r\nfunction Route({computedMatch, ...props}) {\r\n  return <ReactRouterRoute {...props} \/>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","After further debugging, we noticed that the workaround of removing `computedMatch` can lead to other unexpected issues. The problem is that the page component which is rendered via `Router` will be recreated several times as props will be changed when `Route` will recalculate `computedProps`. As a result, we encountered transition flickering issues and extra requests to API.\r\n \r\nAfter deeper investigation, we found another more complex workaround and looks like it covers all the issues. The main idea is to fix `findViewItemByRouteInfo` method from [`ReactRouterViewStack`](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/ReactRouterViewStack.tsx#L99) so it will never return invalid view item. This method is provided via context so we can easily patch it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {\r\n  forwardRef,\r\n  useContext,\r\n  useMemo,\r\n} from \"react\";\r\n\r\nimport {\r\n  IonRouterOutlet,\r\n  RouteManagerContext,\r\n} from \"@ionic\/react\";\r\nimport isEqual from \"lodash\/isEqual\";\r\nimport omit from \"lodash\/omit\";\r\n\r\nfunction IonRouterOutletPatched({children, ...otherProps}, ref) {\r\n  const routeManagerContextValue = useContext(RouteManagerContext);\r\n  const findViewItemByRouteInfoOriginal =\r\n    routeManagerContextValue.findViewItemByRouteInfoOriginal ||\r\n    routeManagerContextValue.findViewItemByRouteInfo;\r\n  const createViewItemOriginal =\r\n    routeManagerContextValue.createViewItemOriginal ||\r\n    routeManagerContextValue.createViewItem;\r\n  const newValue = useMemo(\r\n    () => ({\r\n      ...routeManagerContextValue,\r\n      findViewItemByRouteInfo(routeInfo, outletId, updateMatch) {\r\n        const viewItem = findViewItemByRouteInfoOriginal(\r\n          routeInfo,\r\n          outletId,\r\n          updateMatch\r\n        );\r\n        \/\/ `matchRoute` is a function from Ionic StackManager\r\n        \/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/main\/packages\/react-router\/src\/ReactRouter\/StackManager.tsx#L433\r\n        \/\/ unfortunatly it is not exported so we just copy it to our utils file\r\n        const routeElement = matchRoute(\r\n          children,\r\n          routeInfo\r\n        );\r\n        if (\r\n          viewItem &&\r\n          routeElement &&\r\n          isEqual(\r\n            viewItem.initialRouteProps,\r\n            omit(routeElement.props, \"children\")\r\n          )\r\n        ) {\r\n          return viewItem;\r\n        }\r\n        \/\/ otherwise undefined will be returned and Ionic will create new viewItem\r\n      },\r\n      createViewItem(outletId, routeElement, routeInfo, page) {\r\n        const viewItem = createViewItemOriginal(\r\n          outletId,\r\n          routeElement,\r\n          routeInfo,\r\n          page\r\n        );\r\n        \/\/ we want to know the route props asociated to current viewItem\r\n        \/\/ so we can find correct viewItem later\r\n        viewItem.initialRouteProps = omit(routeElement.props, \"children\");\r\n        return viewItem;\r\n      },\r\n      \/\/ save original context methods to ensure that we never lead to recursion if you use nested routes\r\n      findViewItemByRouteInfoOriginal,\r\n      createViewItemOriginal,\r\n    }),\r\n    [routeManagerContextValue]\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <RouteManagerContext.Provider value={newValue}>\r\n      <IonRouterOutlet ref={ref} {...otherProps}>\r\n        {children}\r\n      <\/IonRouterOutlet>\r\n    <\/RouteManagerContext.Provider>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\/\/ forwarding ref to ensure that IonRouterOutlet will work as expected in any scenario\r\nconst IonRouterOutletPatchedWithForwardedRef = forwardRef(\r\n  IonRouterOutletPatched\r\n);\r\n\/\/ IonTabs children should be IonRouterOutlet or element with isRouterOutlet=true\r\n\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/71a7af0f52fe62937b1dea1ca2739e78801a2a6d\/packages\/react\/src\/components\/navigation\/IonTabs.tsx#L106\r\nIonRouterOutletPatchedWithForwardedRef.isRouterOutlet = true;\r\nexport default IonRouterOutletPatchedWithForwardedRef;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAll you need is just to use `IonRouterOutletPatched` instead of `IonRouterOutlet`.

You can easily reproduce it by replacing it with `false`.\r\n\r\nSo my questions to @legendar specifically are:\r\n- Why do we need this check?\r\n- Is there something else we can use instead?\r\n- Can we use something other than `isEqual` to evaluate that?\r\n- What version of `lodash` are you using?","I have fixed the infinite loop by omitting the `fallback` prop by doing `omit(routeElement.props, ['children', 'fallback'])`.","@NickAlvesX This check is the main idea of the workaround =) We compare route props that were used when creating the current viewItem (`initialRouteProps`) with current route props (`routeElement.props`). If they are not equal then ionic calculated the wrong viewItem and we return undefined.\r\n`children` was omitted to prevent an infinite loop as they are always not equal. I think `render` and `component` props should be omitted as well. We don't use any other render methods except `children` in our project so this is why this code works for us. \r\nBut yeah all other non-standard methods (like `fallback` in your case) should also be omitted.

Using reorder on a list of ion-item elements wrapped in ion-reorder tags is currently unfeasible on touch devices. Moving your finger up or down an item immediately initiates reorder, which prevents the user from scrolling the page.\r\n2. Currently ion-item-sliding doesn't work on ion-item elements wrapped in ion-reorder tags.\r\n3. Long-pressing to reorder is a common UI feature. (See the iOS built-in Reminders app, among others.)\n\n### Describe Preferred Solution\n\nAdd an optional require-long-press prop to ion-reorder-group, which if set to true would require a long press before starting reorder.\n\n### Describe Alternatives\n\nI tried using a custom long-press gesture to toggle the ion-reorder-group disabled prop from false to true, but this doesn't work because the initial press event then doesn't register in ion-reorder-group.\n\n### Related Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI'll be submitting a pull request which implements the feature in the next day or two.","comments":["Thanks for the issue.

The problem here is that we need to approximate the height of the keyboard, and we appear to be overestimating. When we adjust the input, we assume that the content will scroll, so we wait for that to finish. There is a 1000ms fallback `setTimeout` in case there is no scrolling, so that is likely what you are running into here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/7315e0157b917d2e3586c64f8082026827812943\/core\/src\/utils\/input-shims\/hacks\/scroll-assist.ts#L142\r\n\r\nWhile we can use the Ionic Keyboard Events to detect the exact height of the keyboard, this event does not fire until the keyboard is fully on screen, leading to a ~300ms delay so we opt to estimate the height instead to make the scroll assist utility more responsive.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to change this \"Safe area\" value: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/7315e0157b917d2e3586c64f8082026827812943\/core\/src\/utils\/input-shims\/hacks\/scroll-data.ts#L37 though we need to make sure that it does not regress https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/21912.\r\n\r\nThis does not impact Cordova\/Capacitor apps because we can use the native Keyboard plugin to get the height of the keyboard before it even opens.","@liamdebeasi By any chance assuming \u2018the keyboard being closed when an input gets focus\u2019 is affecting the calculation for switching focus while the keyboard is already open?

Sorry, not sure how I missed this. I understand this reply may come too late, but one thing you can try is setting the focus of the page in the `ionViewDidEnter` lifecycle if you are using routing.\r\n\r\nSo something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nionViewDidEnter() {\r\n  titleEl.focus();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the DOM nodes are in view, so you should be able to make the behavior consistent.

Some platforms such as iOS have restrictions surrounding programmatically focusing elements that are not done as a result of user gestures, so there may be times when you cannot move focus manually (depending on when it happens).\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI did some preliminary research on how to best solve this, and the way native apps (across both iOS and Android) do this is pretty inconsistent. Some will focus the title in the header, some in the content, and some focus something totally different. We are exploring ways we can make this behavior more predictable in Ionic, though we are intentionally being cautious as moving focus on behalf of the user can ruin an app's UX if not done correctly."],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: tabindex adverse effect after adding clear-input=\"true\"","body":"# Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Ionic version:**\r\nAs per latest on CDN\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\nWhen you fill an input item that has clear input set to true and then press tab the focus does not move to the next element.

However, I've discovered if the user logs in, visits an authenticated page, and then logs out, the `PrivateRoute` is still triggered even though the component no longer exists in DOM. \r\n\r\n**This is a problem because now that the user is not authenticated, the PrivateRoute still triggers and `Redirect`s to the `auth` URL (which is the fallback for unauthenticated users in the PrivateRoute component).**\r\n\r\nHere's a video demo:\r\n\r\n- On page load, I am on the Log In page (unauthenticated).\r\n- I click login (which authenticates the user and routes the user to the `account` page, which is a PrivateRoute)\r\n- I visit Tab 2 (an unauthenticated route) which has a `logout` button and click it. The user is `Redirected` to the `auth` page automatically, which shouldn't happen because I'm currently on the Tab2 unauthenticated page (but the `PrivateRoute` is still triggered).\r\n- I then try to click `Tab2` to go back, but since the `PrivateRoute` is still being triggered, it's forcing me to stay on the `Login` page. I emphasize this by clicking on the tab2 button alot and you can see the console log counter increasing (that counter is logging from within the private route component).\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/25097099\/123508257-22254780-d623-11eb-8787-3c5d21d0ce99.mov\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox**\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/pensive-voice-1w3rc?file=\/src\/App.tsx\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Visit the Log In Tab\r\n2. Click Log In\r\n3. Click Tab 2\r\n4. Click Log Out\r\n5. Observe how you are unable to click to change any tab and how the private route is still triggered when changing tabs in the console.\r\n\r\nAlso if you view the DOM, you will see that the `Account` page HTML doesn't even persist in the page, so I was thinking it's just not being evicted from the RouterStack properly? \r\n\r\nThis one has eluded me for about a whole year, but I believe I finally have a reproducible example!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug. -->\r\n\r\nI expect the PrivateRoute to not be triggered on pages that are unauthenticated.

The problem here looks to be that the `PrivateRoute` is never getting unmounted, so it will continue to redirect. I was able to verify this behavior in another app I have that uses a custom `PrivateRoute`. Since Ionic React needs to manage its own stack, this is \"working as intended\", though I do not think the behavior is desirable in this case.\r\n\r\nOne solution I can think of is to add a way of purging authenticated routes from the stack when logging out. Right now you just use the `history.replace` method, but that would only replace the most recent history entry as opposed to clearing all old entries. Additionally, you could call `history.replace` when clicking Tab2 though there is https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/22511 which prevents that from being useful right now."],"labels":["package: react","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: scrollToPoint resolves, but `ionScroll` events are fired after","body":"# Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Ionic version:**\r\n[x] **5.x**\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\nWhen ion-content is scrolled using `scrollToPoint`, etc., even after finished waiting `scrollToPoint `(using await), the `ionScroll `event will be fired afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis is probably because the `ionScroll `event is issued by stencil's `readTask()`.\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/d5980354fa1672839fa7e89e8fc91cfa524e3f03\/core\/src\/components\/content\/content.tsx#L169\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nIf you await `scrollToPoint`, then the `ionScroll `event will not be fired after the await is completed.\r\n\r\nI think this was done to avoid heavy processing by the `ionScroll `event, but I think the unintuitive timing\/order of the event is a source of confusion.\r\nCould you please consider the option of not firing the ionScroll event in the `readTask()`?\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1.

As a result, using the native back button (or browser back button) afterwards returns the user back to page **B** while naturally you would not expect it.

Another instance of the page renders with `{s1: 'a', s2:'b'}` as expected.\r\n3. Click on `<ion-back-button>` on the page.

If the custom component uses ion-page as its root element, there are two ion-page elements inside of the modal.\r\n\r\nThis default behavior is bad for a couple of reasons:\r\n1. Vue components that are used inside of modals may end up being reused as regular content pages. There are plenty of cases where this happens in our app. So either we leave `<ion-page>` as the parent in these components and you end up having two `<ion-page>` elements embedded when the component is used as a modal, or we write some hacky logic to determine whether or not the component has been placed inside of a modal and remove the ion-page parent when so.\r\n2. Not all use cases of ion-modal will see ion-page as the root parent inside the modal. For example, you may need routing inside of a modal in which case ion-nav should be the immediate child of the ion-modal and ion-page will be inside of the ion-nav.\r\n\r\n**Describe Preferred Solution**\r\nEither remove the ion-page automatically generated inside of ion-modal completely and let the custom component decide when and where to place the page, or only add ion-page if the root element of the custom component isn't already an ion-page or ion-nav.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction**\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Giwayume\/ion-vue-modal-page-bug\r\n\r\n**Related Code**\r\n\r\nsome-component.vue\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n    <ion-page>\r\n        <ion-content>Hello World<\/ion-content>\r\n    <\/ion-page>\r\n<\/template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nmodal-creator.ts\r\n```\r\nimport { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue';\r\nimport { modalController } from '@ionic\/vue';\r\nconst modal = await modalController.create({\r\n    component: defineAsyncComponent(() => import('.\/some-component.vue'))\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this modal is created, it will have this markup:\r\n```\r\n<ion-modal>\r\n    <ion-backdrop \/>\r\n    <div class=\"modal-wrapper\">\r\n        <div class=\"ion-page\">\r\n            <div class=\"ion-page\">\r\n                <ion-content>Hello World<\/ion-content>\r\n            <\/div>\r\n        <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n<\/ion-modal>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, it should have this markup:\r\n```\r\n<ion-modal>\r\n    <ion-backdrop \/>\r\n    <div class=\"modal-wrapper\">\r\n        <div class=\"ion-page\">\r\n            <ion-content>Hello World<\/ion-content>\r\n        <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n<\/ion-modal>\r\n```","comments":["Thanks for the issue. Could you provide an GitHub repo that shows the issues you are running into?","@liamdebeasi \r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Giwayume\/ion-vue-modal-page-bug\r\n\r\nIn this example, 2 ion-page elements are generated.\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/4075314\/118371926-d770d400-b57c-11eb-87b0-2d8c431bd35d.png)\r\n","Thanks! `.ion-page` is mostly used for 2 things: Routing and making sure the inner contents of your component are displayed at full size. `ion-modal` does not participate in routing, and I can see the inner content of your modal is being displayed at full size.Having two `.ion-page` classes should not cause issues. Is there an example in that repo that shows any of the issues you described in your initial post?","My problems are with bad markup and the problems that result from it. The examples I was listing above was about bad markup being generated, not that it necessarily causes styling issues in a vanilla ionic app.\r\n\r\nSaying 2 embedded pages doesn't cause any issues right now is kind of the same as saying it's OK to put a div inside of a span because it still works even though it's invalid W3C markup.\r\n\r\nOne problem is this won't let me be exact with styling. For example, instead of writing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nion-app > ion-modal > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > ion-header {\r\n    \/* Whatever *\/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have to cover all bases, and this multiplies in complexity with the more variants I need:\r\n\r\n```\r\nion-app > ion-modal > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > ion-header,\r\nion-app > ion-modal > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > .ion-page > ion-header {\r\n    \/* Whatever *\/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother problem is say I needed to design my app where all pages have a 16px padding around them? Well now modals have 32px instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.ion-page {\r\n    padding: 16px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple example, but I could be adding any CSS to ion-page elements that stacks undesirably.\r\n\r\nIt's also not great to have design inconsistency across the different framework integrations. For example, \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/api\/modal\r\n\r\nIn Angular & React you create the ion-page element in your template. In Vue you don't. Why?\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/packages\/vue\/src\/framework-delegate.ts#L15-L17\r\n\r\nI'm going to make a wild guess and say the only reason this was done was because it's a simple solution to guarantee that the root element has the 'ion-page' class on it, judging by the code.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/8e0e5da7407adecb7471b3a6b0ac059337761355\/core\/src\/components\/modal\/modal.tsx#L154\r\n\r\nThe VNode interface should give you enough information to make a smart decision on whether or not this extra div is necessary depending on what's inside the Vue component's template.","While I agree it would be good to only add the `.ion-page` if not already present, I am having a hard time understanding how the problem manifests. \r\n\r\nUsing this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.ion-page {\r\n    padding: 16px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy not just target the `ion-content` inside of your component rather than add all of these styles globally? If you are trying to add padding around your content, you can just add the `ion-padding` utility class to `ion-content`:\r\n\r\n\r\n`<ion-content class=\"ion-padding\">`\r\n\r\nThe `.ion-page` class is really just a structural class and not something that we recommend developers target themselves, so this tells me there may be an easier way to accomplish what you are trying to do.","I was only giving an example of where a problem could manifest, I'm not specifically adding padding to ion-page. From what I've seen, designers and customers almost never want out-of-the-box styles in their app, so the markup should be well designed and flexible enough to handle these situations.","Thanks. I am not opposed to making these changes, but in order to effectively resolve this issue I really need to understand the use case you have that makes this change necessary.\r\n\r\nWith styling a component inside of Vue, you should be able to use scoped styles so that you do not need to add these long global selectors:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nion-app > ion-modal > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > ion-header,\r\nion-app > ion-modal > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > .ion-page > ion-header {\r\n    \/* Whatever *\/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you want to style _all_ modals globally you still should not need to write out these long selectors. You should be able to just target `ion-modal ion-header` directly. You might run into issues with CSS specificity, but we plan on addressing this for `ion-modal` and `ion-popover` in Framework v6. One thought instead is to set a class on the modals and target that class instead of a generic `ion-modal` selector.\r\n\r\nCould you try those alternatives and let me know if it helps at all?\r\n\r\nedit:\r\n\r\nAs an example, you can add the following styles to `App.vue` to style all modals without needing to use the long selectors you currently have:\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<style>\r\n  ion-modal ion-toolbar,\r\n  ion-modal ion-content {\r\n    --background: #0088cc;\r\n    --color: white;\r\n  }\r\n<\/style>\r\n```","It's not really that simple,\r\n\r\nSay for example I have a custom ion-header component that displays as the header on every page\/modal. It needs to know whether or not it's displaying in a modal on a page that's not currently hidden by the nav in order to control what goes in the template.\r\n\r\nThe Javascript for this gets quite complicated, when having to make guesses about when an ion-page might or might not appear.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet isActiveModalHeader = false;\r\nconst modalEl = this.$el.closest('ion-modal');\r\nif (modalEl) {\r\n\tif (modalEl.querySelector(':scope > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > ion-header, :scope > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > .ion-page > ion-header') === this.$el) {\r\n\t\tisActiveModalHeader = true;\r\n\t}\r\n\tmodalEl.querySelectorAll(':scope > .modal-wrapper > ion-nav > .ion-page:not(.ion-page-hidden) > ion-header, :scope > .modal-wrapper > .ion-page > ion-nav > .ion-page:not(.ion-page-hidden) > ion-header').forEach((header) => {\r\n\t\tif (this.$el === header) {\r\n\t\t\tisActiveModalHeader = true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe selector specificity is necessary because we don't want to dig down deeper into a case where it's used as a sub-header that may appear on a tab page inside the modal, or a similar case.\r\n\r\nHonestly I would think generating clean markup would be motivation enough to fix this, especially since the usage differs between frameworks. Design consistency is valuable in upon itself.","Thanks for the additional example. I agree that this is something we should account for and de-duplicate if necessary. I double checked and this behavior is consistent with what Ionic React and Ionic Angular do so the changes will need to be made there as well."],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: ios, two finger swipe up gesture not working in standalone app\/pwa","body":"# Bug Report\r\n\r\n**Ionic version:**\r\n\r\n[ ] **4.x**\r\n[x] **5.x**\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\n\"Two-finger swipe up\" when voiceover is on in iOS app, should \"Speak the entire screen from the top\" at the moment voiceover does not read anything from the top. voiceover gesture can be found [here](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-in\/guide\/iphone\/iph3e2e2281\/ios)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\"Two-finger swipe up\" when voiceover is on should read everything on screen from the top in iOS.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1) open the ionic app in iOS device\r\n2) turn on VoiceOver \r\n3) and do a \"Two-finger swipe up\" \r\n\r\nyou'll notice that, Voice over does not read anything from the top. however one thing to notice is that, when \"Two-finger swipe down\" voice over should \"Speak the entire screen from the selected item\" is working. \r\n\r\nLet me know if more information is needed to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","comments":["Thanks for the issue!

It appears that if a user is routed to a page before its matching tab button is rendered on the page, the button does not receive the \"selected\" property.\r\n\r\nVideo recreation here (explanation of what you see in the video beneath): https:\/\/streamable.com\/lkqvns\r\n\r\n1. I first show when on the Profile page, the tab is highlighted to match the url in the browser as expected. This tab is displayed because the user object in the `useAuth` context is populated.\r\n2. I refresh the page, which resets the user property to undefined which means that the Login tab should display.\r\n\r\nI define my dynamic tab buttons like the following in my `App.tsx`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             {user ? (\r\n                <IonTabButton tab=\"profile\" href=\"\/profile\">\r\n                  <IonIcon icon={send} \/>\r\n                  <IonLabel>Profile<\/IonLabel>\r\n                <\/IonTabButton>\r\n              ) : (\r\n                <IonTabButton tab=\"login\" href=\"\/login\">\r\n                  <IonIcon icon={person} \/>\r\n                  <IonLabel>Login<\/IonLabel>\r\n                <\/IonTabButton>\r\n              )}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. In order to simulate a \"network call\" to authenticate, I have a `useEffect` in my `Auth` context that sleeps for a few seconds before populating the `user` object. \r\n4. Since the user is now populated in the context, the displayed tab switches from Login to Profile as expected, however the tab itself doesn't display as \"selected\" even though we are on the `\/profile` URL as defined in my `App.tsx`\r\n\r\nCodeSandbox recreation: https:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/adoring-cori-xhu13?file=\/src\/Auth.tsx\r\n\r\nObviously it seems like the tab bar needs an additional re-render to apply the `selected` class because if I add a `setLoading(true)` and `setLoading(false)` within the \"network call\" to populate the user object in my Auth context, it causes the tab to update and show as \"selected\". I left these `useState`'s in my code but commented them out for you to mess with in `Auth.tsx` line 47.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may seem like a weird test scenario but I'm dealing with something very similar after re-routing on authentication that causes the the current tab to not show as \"selected\" which will sometimes also result in the login form HTML being displayed on a **completely different tab than it should**. I was able to re-create the \"selected\" scenario here using this basic use case and I'm betting it'll fix the issue in my full app due to it rendering and setting the tabs correctly. I hope that makes sense. \r\n\r\nNOTE: THE URL IN CODESANDBOX MUST BE \"\/profile\" as shown in the demo video. A super easy way to recreate this issue is to type that url in the codesandbox url input and hit enter.

Additionally, there were some routing related issues fixed in Ionic Vue 5.6.4 so I also recommend updating your app to that version.","Hi @liamdebeasi ,\r\nFinally, I am able to simulate bugs by automating the route changes :-) . \r\n\r\nGit repository for reproducible bug \r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/stripathix\/ionic-blank-route-issue\r\n\r\nLink to video of error happening. In video, you can see this bug is intermittent. Where it worked fine second time when i refreshed. But the third time it again fails.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ILWnyhC297Y\r\n\r\nI think it is something related to a race condition where if you change routing very fast then ionic-router outlet is left blank without any route.\r\n\r\nSee in below screen shot where ionic-router-outlet is not having any ion-page.\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-04-17 at 11 13 23 PM\" src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/8480351\/115121854-85b34900-9fd2-11eb-99d2-ffc1b226a8e9.png\">\r\n\r\nIt can be easily recovered from if you navigate to different route with error of .classlist first time when you click on menu navigation. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to handle also because it fails so silent there is not even any log in console which somehow we can catch and send programmatically navigate user to some other view. This issue is really problematic when its Iphone because then user just see blank screen. Menu drawer is hidden and user will not even know if he has to drag to reveal menu drawer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo simulate bug what i am doing is in main.js file after application is mounted i have a settimeout nested to call route changes quickly one after another.\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nconst fallbackRoute = 'app.dashboard';\r\nconst defaultHomeViewState = 'app.about'\r\nconst navigateToRoute = () => {\r\n  const lastState = router.currentRoute.value.name;\r\n  router.replace({\r\n    name: lastState === fallbackRoute ? defaultHomeViewState : fallbackRoute,\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nfunction initiateBugSimulation() {\r\n  console.log('#######initiateBugSimulation######');\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    navigateToRoute();\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      navigateToRoute();\r\n    }, 10);\r\n  }, 10);\r\n}\r\n\r\nrouter.isReady().then(() => {\r\n  app.mount('#app');\r\n  setTimeout(() => {\r\n    initiateBugSimulation();\r\n  }, 3000);\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n","Thanks! I can reproduce this. The problem is likely that your script does not wait for the async transition to finish: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/packages\/vue\/src\/components\/IonRouterOutlet.ts#L256\r\n\r\nReplacing from page A --> page B works, but then replacing from page B --> page A quickly would cause both pages to get unmounted. I need to see if this impacts Ionic React\/Angular as well. I am not sure I would consider this a bug in our code, though I think we can make some improvements in our routing integration to avoid situations like this."],"labels":["type: feature request"]},{"title":"feat: improve performance when using ion-item-sliding","body":"<!-- Before submitting an issue, please consult our docs (https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you are posting an issue pertaining to the Ionic Framework.

Please include if your feature request is related to a problem. -->\r\n\r\nWhen rendering lists of items with complex structures including `ion-item-sliding` and `ion-item-options`, DOM rendering can be incredibly expensive. This is exacerbated on mobile devices with weaker G\/CPUs and less memory where rendering performance is generally slow.\r\n\r\nIt is not currently a \"supported feature\" to show the contents of items dynamically when sliding begins, then hide them again when sliding ends, to keep DOM node count and initial render under control.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this makes it difficult to create custom components that use `ion-item-sliding` and insert slotted content into `ion-item-options` elements, or even insert their own, conditionally via `ng-content` or a similar composition technique.\r\n\r\n**There are a few problems that get in the way of this:**\r\n\r\n1. Lack of observable or event that would notify strictly on item is open or not (boolean). This can be done using the `(ionDrag)` event, but it's a bit painful.\r\n2. Width of `options-start\/end` is calculated at initial render time. If items are added\/removed conditionally from these slots using `*ngIf` or the like, the window for which the sliding item will open does not adjust its width. Therefore when the item is slid open, then elements are rendered (fade in animation to make it nice), the item will snap closed again because it does not believe there is anything to show.\r\n3. The sliding animation is jittery on many devices (seems mostly chromium based issue) which can lead to strange gestures and things snapping closed again while dragging.\r\n\r\n**Describe Preferred Solution**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n**`ion-item-sliding` should:**\r\n1. Publish an observable or event emitter that simply reports \"am I open or not\".\r\n2. Width of items should be calculated before and after `(ionDrag)` has been started. If new elements have been added, the width should be adjusted. A `ContentObserver` comes to mind so that a fixed-width pre-rendered placeholder is not required.\r\n\r\n**Describe Alternatives**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\nBasically hack this in and implement it manually, which is complex and difficult to get right due to the need to set a fixed width to a placeholder element inside the `ion-item-options` component so that once sliding starts, the item will know it has contents, set a width, and stay open\/not snap closed again.\r\n\r\n**Related Code**\r\n<!-- If you are able to illustrate the feature request with an example, please provide a sample application via an online code collaborator such as [StackBlitz](https:\/\/stackblitz.com), or [GitHub](https:\/\/github.com). -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ion-item-options  *ngIf=\"state.isSlidingEnabled\" [hidden]=disabled #optionsEnd class=\"animate-fade-in\"> \r\n     <ng-container slot=\"options-end\">\r\n            <ng-container *ngIf=\"state.sliderOpen; else placeholderTemplate\">\r\n              <ng-container *ngIf=\"sliderOpen\">\r\n                 <!-- Actual contents we want dynamically rendered -->\r\n                <ion-item-option color=\"transparent\"\r\n                  (tap)=\"item.toggleSlider()\">\r\n                  <ion-icon slot=top name=\"chevron-forward\">\r\n                  <\/ion-icon>\r\n                <\/ion-item-option>\r\n              <\/ng-container>\r\n              <ng-template #placeholderTemplate>\r\n                  <div style=\"width: 185px\"> <!-- Fixed width placeholder -->\r\n                  <\/div>\r\n              <\/ng-template>\r\n...\r\n  <\/ion-item-options>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n<!-- List any other information that is relevant to your issue.

Can you provide a GitHub repo that shows the performance issue as it is right now?","@liamdebeasi This issue isn't about the performance issue. It's more about conditional rendering. Trying to keep them separate, but wanted to explain some of the motivation for this. This one is an issue even if you just want to conditionally render things inside sliding item options. But I'll see what I can do when I get a minute.","Thanks for the follow up. I guess I am confused as the first post calls out performance as a motivation for this issue in the first paragraph, so I am trying to understand how these issues appear in applications.","@liamdebeasi Fair, it is performance motivated - that was the initial reason why I implemented this workaround a few months back - and am now revisiting it as I'm trying to address major perf issues on mobile devices. I'd certainly love to just shove all the elements on screen at once and have it work out. _But the issue is still a problem when you want to add\/remove things from `ion-item-options` elements conditionally._ I understand the need for a repro and will do my best.\r\n\r\nAlso not intending to be... err... mansplaining, I guess? I know you're an expert in this stuff. Just trying to explain a bit what I think is going on.\r\n\r\n**Counting the DOM:**\r\n\r\n- `ion-item-sliding`: 1 to 3 (depending if you have no options, or options on both sides). This one is lean.\r\n- `ion-item`: 11 elements just for slots and item-inner\/wrapper\r\n- `ion-item-option`\/`ion-button`: 15 at a minimum, each.\r\n\r\nEach `<ion-button>` element added to a sliding item can result in upwards of 15-20 DOM elements *per `ion-item-option`.\r\n\r\nSo adding this up. We have close to 30 DOM elements just to show the skeleton of an `ion-item-sliding` with one option. This is OK so far, well within reason.\r\n\r\nNow let's make it 5 options (not uncommon). Now each item requires ~90 DOM elements. Now add your own content to the item. Call it 100 to account for a few `ion-label`s and `ion-icon`s in the item itself, maybe a '...' button at the end.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a list of 100 items.  At 100 elements per item, that means 10,000 DOM elements that need to be created all at once just to show the initial render.\r\n\r\nOn a mobile device that can be crushing. 7500 of these elements could be conditionally rendered only as needed - if item options allowed it. 100 items in a list is not uncommon, and shouldn't require virtual scrolling. Even 500 list items should be... sort of reasonable, you could incrementally load it. But that's just my current line of thinking of why this is a perf issue.\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/362329\/113734126-13389400-96c9-11eb-93b2-6c493331f2eb.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/362329\/113734029-fc923d00-96c8-11eb-9ed9-1e6c31415590.png)\r\n","@liamdebeasi PS.

I can reproduce the behavior your are describing. I have not dug too much into this yet, but there seem to be a few factors that contribute to this performance issue:\r\n\r\n1. Angular: I see a lot of Angular-specific code running in a Timeline test on Chrome dev tools. Reproducing this issue outside of Angular does reduce the delays, though there is definitely more in Ionic\/Stencil world that we need to improve.\r\n2. `ion-item-sliding` gesture and setup code: There is a lot of JavaScript that we currently run when creating an instance of `ion-item-sliding`. In particular, code related to the gesture and computing values seem to be the most costly here. We do have plans to refactor this as part of https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/22909, so that would be a good opportunity to address any performance issues there as well.\r\n3. Number of DOM elements: As part of our refactor, we should also look to reduce the number of DOM elements rendered as part of this component usage. We likely will not be able to reduce the number of elements used for components like `ion-item` or `ion-button`, but streamlining `ion-item-options` and `ion-item-sliding` is something we are definitely interested in.\r\n\r\nI will keep this issue open for now, but will re-evaluate when we get around to tackling https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/22909.\r\n\r\n> PS. Not sure if I'm missing it or if it's still a thing, but I don't think the stackblitz repos have been updated for Ionic 5.\r\n\r\nThis is on our to-do list for our Framework v5.7.0 work, which is the next minor release of Framework v5: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/milestone\/101.","Forgot to add this, but does that pretty much cover the issues you are seeing? Is there anything I missed?","Thanks @liamdebeasi  -- Partly. This mostly covers the performance related aspects regarding Stencil\/Ionic - that part looks good.\r\n\r\nHowever I am not sure it addresses the actual feature requested my original description, which is the ability to only render the contents of `ion-item-options` when the item is opened on the respective side. I am also not sure it addresses the ability to add options\/components while the slider is open\/opening (properly resizing).\r\n\r\nRegardless of how efficient you get the stencil code to be... we still either need conditional rendering of `ion-item-options` or the ability to do it ourselves so that what _we_ put into the slider can be handled efficiently as well.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/362329\/113752293-c8c01300-96da-11eb-8926-85ad2234fb70.mov\r\n\r\nI think this issue should probably be split up. One for the features I requested (this one or whichever you feel is most appropriate given this one really shifted toward perf), and one for the performance problems, which is what I attempted (and likely failed to do) by referencing the original performance issue: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/23116 -- does that make sense?","Assuming we resolve most of the outstanding performance issues with `ion-item-sliding`, what would the use case for this feature be? As far as I am aware this kind of functionality does not exist in the native sliding component on iOS. When the sliding options are not revealed, we hide them using `display: none` so there should not be many performance issues related to these.","I guess another way to think about this is where most of the performance issues are coming from `ion-item-sliding`, being able to remove `ion-item-option` elements from the DOM until they are ready to be shown likely will not make much of a difference. Another thing to consider is would manually removing\/adding them to the DOM be creating more work for the browser as opposed to just leaving them in the DOM and hiding them with `display: none`.","@liamdebeasi In general, the use case is I am putting something heavy into the `ion-sliding-options` **(not an `ion-item-option`)** that I don't want to render for each item unless the user interacts with that specific item.\r\n\r\nWithout the ability to defer this rendering, it will cause the same performance problems that you'll be spending time to fix. I am not familiar with the native iOS slider component, but you guys have the feature so we're using it :) Rendering 100 elements when a specific item is slid open is a lot better than rendering 10,000 elements when the whole list shows up. It's the same issue.\r\n\r\nThe only features we need to support this are more responsive sizing of the `ion-item-options` in the sliders, and an event to let us know if the options are visible at all or not. I've implemented this myself using the `(ionDrag)` event, but I still can't get the slider to respect the new size of the options.

Sorry, watch the video clip I attached above. It demonstrates adding an element while the slider is in motion. The size isn't correctly computed until the slider is opened, then closed, then reopened quickly (in my impl. because I have a debounce on the state change, see code snippit just above).\r\n\r\n> I guess another way to think about this is where most of the performance issues are coming from ion-item-sliding, being able to remove ion-item-option elements from the DOM until they are ready to be shown likely will not make much of a difference. Another thing to consider is would manually removing\/adding them to the DOM be creating more work for the browser as opposed to just leaving them in the DOM and hiding them with display: none.\r\n\r\nMaybe. I'm not 100% convinced. There's a lot of purple (rendering) in my benchmarks too. But I am not intimate enough with the browser rendering process to know the cost difference between `display: none` and not rendered at all. If the JS performance-hit is slowing down rendering *that much* I could see that.\r\n\r\nRegardless, let's assume there is a heavy Angular, Style, or other JavaScript cost to instantiating the user's components too. The core issue remains unchanged I believe. Maybe there are images in there, for example. That shouldn't be loaded until slid open... etc etc. Simply having images in the slider (think SVGs) would bottleneck the HTTP request performance for the browser as it resolves URLs.","PS. FWIW our users love the ability to slide items open. It's a great feature, heavily used even on Desktop.","@liamdebeasi In general though, when rendering many things -- assuming loops are the bane of performance -- isn't it best practice to render as little as possible until necessary (or give the option to), unless in specific instances where rendering batches of items in the same tick\/frame prevents exploding layout recalcs?\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something?","PS. This is a video of the whole hodgepodge put together, using a placeholder to force the width, and then fading the elements in, on first interaction:\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty seamless and prevents pre-rendering every element under the sliding item :)\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/362329\/113757649-d9738780-96e0-11eb-98c8-f9cb12aa1e17.mov\r\n\r\nOH. I forgot to mention another critical issue that really requires this feature... these items are transparent to support the theme background gradient  :D \r\n\r\nIf you pre-render the contents of the item-sliding (or forget to set them to opacity: 0), it breaks everything because they bleed through. So you need to be able to toggle the opacity or something to that effect anyway. So that's yet another use-case for having the triggers feature you just linked. But it relates to this because this can easily done using dynamic rendering and solves two problems with one solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","You could even start rendering the options when the user puts their finger on the item, before they even start a swipe, to prevent any appearance of \"nothing here\" rendering jank, if a fade is undesirable.","> Ah yeah!

Omitting a few buttons likely will not make a big difference. I guess what I am saying is if we address the main performance issues, removing these option buttons from the DOM ideally would not even be necessary and would just be creating more work for yourself. However, I won't be able to make that assessment until the initial performance issues are resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan on refactoring the `ion-item-sliding` component with desktop + performance improvements as part of our Framework v6 work which is already underway. I am not saying \"no\" to the other improvements noted in this thread, I am just saying that the team here needs to work on the performance improvements first before we can accurately determine what other work needs to happen. I will keep this issue open for now and will update this thread when we have completed work on the updates. Thanks!","@liamdebeasi That makes sense. And I hope you're right that it won't make a difference to have a \"few\" extra buttons. I'm just doing the math in my head and those buttons make a lot of nodes :) As long as you don't break what I've done ;) Haha! (I kid, I kid)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing what you can come up with. Until then, I hope this has been helpful at least. Your great work and valuable thoughts are always appreciated over here.","Agreed. I appreciate all the clarifying information you have given!","Oh one last thought regarding this: \r\n\r\n> the biggest hits to performance will be rendering ion-item-sliding given what we need to do to compute dimensions and get the gesture setup\r\n\r\nAny way to defer gesture initialization\/dimensions until the finger hits the element? (Obviously you need a listener of some kind to catch the initial & subsequent events) Just spitballing here. Could be the ultimate optimization but likely not doable, hah!","One actual last thought (hopefully) I'll leave here -- since this issue has kept me up for a few weeks and I just can't seem to get it off my mind (our primary value-driving  screens use this feature extensively) and I'm having a hell of a time making things feel fast.\r\n\r\nMy real-world testing (and that stackblitz) really both demonstrate that rendering or deferring the `ion-item-options` has a massive performance impact. Deferring the rendering of options speeds up the initial render of the list by **over 2x**, cuts the rendering time more than in half, in my testing (even on fast computers).\r\n\r\nI really feel strongly that this should not be discounted as a general performance optimization (or at least be made more easily possible \/ optional as I've specified above in the issue desc, but, until I work for Ionic I don't expect to have more influence than what I've said here ;) \r\n\r\nThe effect is really hit home when you run the stackblitz on a low-end mobile device (Even a Google Pixel XL2 at this point suffers), which according to latest reports, mid-range devices now make up most of the mobile market. Flagships with fast CPUs will drop even more, by percentage.\r\n\r\nI know I'm preaching to the choir again, but while it's true that the primary performance hit might be the javascript, sometimes taking the low hanging fruit can make the stuff at the top feel more attainable, and on these devices, every little bit matters a lot.\r\n\r\nCarry on! Thanks again.","This recording shows just how much impact deferring those options has. Now, performance tuning of those options might be another story, but... in the current state, they seem to matter a lot.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/362329\/113888530-6d505c80-9790-11eb-83ff-cd4b445172e0.mov\r\n\r\n","Hey @liamdebeasi, I know you're super busy - sorry to bug you, is the `<ion-item-sliding>` refactor still on deck for V6?

We are focused on getting the remaining Ionic 6 API changes finished and then we will work on bugs\/performance improvements\/etc.","I hope bumping this is OK since I'm thinking this may have gotten lost in the mix (no longer labeled for v6.x \/ part of the milestone). Just checking in. Feel free to ignore.","@lincolnthree Is the original performance issue still a problem with Ionic 7? Ionic Framework is focused on mobile apps, so the desktop changes I noted previously are not likely to happen. However, I wanted to see if the performance issues are still relevant so we can address them.","Thanks @liamdebeasi - We definitely do still have some perf issues with item-sliding, but I'll check the repro repo with V7.  It's probably worth making sure the general issue is the same (or isn't caused by something else at this point.)","Sorry for the delay. On vacation and had to get to wifi.\r\n\r\nYes, there is still a significant difference in rendering performance here, though I can't tell you exactly what the reason is right now since I'm in the mountains and borrowing time and getting glares ;)\r\n\r\nFirst two script execution timings on the timeline are \"with sliding options enabled\", and the last three are with sliding options disabled\/not rendered:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1251\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/362329\/276a40ff-acd8-434c-a878-d6c8456236d6\">\r\n\r\nHere is an updated branch\/repro repo:\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/lincolnthree\/ionic-bugs\/tree\/issue-23155\r\n\r\nWithout digging farther, I can't tell you if the perf drop is due to the simple overhead of rendering more components, or if there's an issue here.","So there are 3 areas where performance is an issue in the sample:\r\n\r\n**Page Load**\r\n\r\nThe app is trying to load 1000 components that each execute their own set of JavaScript. This is really more of a device performance issue than an Ionic bug. I'd recommend implementing virtual or infinite scrolling for this so your app does not try to load all the components at once. Lower end devices realistically are not going to be able to load and execute JS for all the components in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\n**Gesture Start**\r\n\r\nWhen the gesture starts I am seeing that Chrome has a lot of long \"Task\" items on the main thread. I need to take a closer look at why this is happening:\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/2721089\/fb15c925-da19-4380-85b0-17f38fffcb80)\r\n\r\n**Gesture Drag**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to drag an item after the gesture starts, the gesture is almost unusable due to how sluggish it is. I did observe that the \"Hit Test\" in Chrome was taking a significant amount of time. I found that using `content-visibility: auto` helped a lot. Can you try adding this to your sample and let me know if it helps improve the performance of the actual drag animation (once the gesture starts)?\r\n\r\n```css\r\nion-item-sliding {\r\n  content-visibility: auto;\r\n}\r\n```","Hey @liamdebeasi, Thanks. I was able to test this, and yes, the performance of dragging sliding items open was *dramatically* improved with this CSS. I was not even aware of the 'auto' mode for `content-visibility`, so thanks for that as well. Looks like it's not particularly well-supported (at all on iOS), unfortunately.\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/assets\/362329\/28adaeba-33e7-4b0e-ac9f-7c06fb2bc802)\r\n\r\nI did test this on Safari on OSX and the dragging performance is indeed still an issue there.\r\n\r\n> I'd recommend implementing virtual or infinite scrolling for this so your app does not try to load all the components at once.\r\n\r\nYes, we do this where possible, but absent a quality virtual scroll solution that can support dynamic-height components, this isn't always feasible. We're generally only rendering 100 of these at a time in such scenarios, but that still impacts lower-performance mobile devices significantly.\r\n\r\nYou had [mentioned previously](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/23155#issuecomment-814332664) that computing dimensions in the startup JS would be the biggest hit, but is there a way to share that work for elements that are rendered in the same parent container? I suppose not 100% reliably, since any element can be rendered with different styles. Maybe use a shared cache where the key is the sliding item dimensions? Not sure what computations are being done, just tossing out ideas.\r\n","> I was not even aware of the 'auto' mode for content-visibility, so thanks for that as well.

However, the showcase here is pretty simplified. \r\n\r\nIn my use case I sort the list by a sort property. This means when the user reorders the elements I update this field after he reordered.\r\n\r\nNow since the parent reorder event is also called by the childs reordering my parent sort order is also updated.\r\n\r\nI can \"fix\" this by checking the target element of the reorder event (added an id to the `reorder-group`) and only call my logic when the ids match.\r\n\r\nThe problem which still persist is that I cannot just disable the child `ion-reorder-group`. Since the parent `ion-reorder-group` is still enabled the `ion-reorder` handles do not get hidden (as seen in the stackblitz example).\r\n\r\nThis could also be \"fixed\" by me with an `*ngIf`. \r\n\r\nNevertheless I still think this is a bug. `ion-reorder` elements should only belong to its closest parent `ion-reorder-group`","@liamdebeasi \r\n\r\nI think the issue lies in this method (at least for the event):\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/de58238333d55334621445cdba4b67b8ba4958a1\/core\/src\/components\/reorder-group\/reorder-group.tsx#L316\r\n\r\nWe should stop the while when we find a reorder-group which is not this reorder group. This should do the trick:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst findReorderItem = (node: HTMLElement | null, container: HTMLElement): HTMLElement | undefined => {\r\n  let parent: HTMLElement | null;\r\n  while (node) {\r\n    parent = node.parentElement;\r\n    if (parent === container) {\r\n      return node;\r\n    } else if (parent.tagName === 'ION-REORDER-GROUP' ) {\r\n      return undefined;\r\n    }\r\n    node = parent;\r\n  }\r\n  return undefined;\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\nRegarding the `disabled` state.

that's what you need, thanks.","Thank you! I ended up increasing the number of `questionIndexes` and I can reproduce the issue now. I am still investigating, but this looks like a WebKit issue. I am running the same code on iOS 14.4 and iOS 13.6 and the issue only happens in iOS 14.4.\r\n\r\nWill post here when I have more info.","Cheers @liamdebeasi, I came to the conclusion is was something in WKWebView, but I'm glad you can replicate it on the same iOS version.","Ok so the issue here is that there seems to be a bug in WebKit where using Web Components with a large number of CSS Variables set on the host causes the performance issues you reported here. I can only reproduce this on iOS 14, so this seems like a fairly new bug.\r\n\r\nI reported this to the WebKit team here: https:\/\/bugs.webkit.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=222187\r\n\r\nTypically we close related Ionic issues out whenever a fix ships in WebKit, so I will update this thread when that happens. Thanks!","Thanks for your timely response to this @liamdebeasi, you're a star.","Hey there,\r\n\r\nIs this issue impacting any apps\/websites you have in production right now?

During page navigation that action sheet appears for a moment in a broken state (let's say 'flashing').\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nNo `IonActionSheet` 'flashing'\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nI don't think that you need to reproduce exactly my case here. Still I was able to find a root cause and it's connected with a fix you introduced in 5.3.4 version (https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/pull\/22167). The page, user navigates to, displays `IonLoading` at the startup, which is dismissed (`onDidDismiss` of loading overlay is resolved) before the same thing from `IonActionSheet` overlay. So, at the moment `IonLoading` was _**presented**_, an `IonActionSheetButton` was an active element, therefore loading overlay returns focus to that button on dismiss and this results in displaying of `IonActionSheet` in some weird state.\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\nI wouldn't say it's a bug, but it's definitely an issue. Moreover, it might be more global than it seems.\r\nSpecifically in my case it's an issue with a pair of Ionic framework components. In the same time, if we take a look at such overlay behavior wider, you're playing with focus without any awareness of app layout and elements structure. Furthermore, you do this after some timeout (of dismiss animation), while other element may already have taken focus (intentionally) and you'll steal it again with no need at all. And speaking of code, I believe it is too much of responsibility for a common overlay component to give focus to whatever element it finds suitable (outside of overlay and modals\/popovers\/etc. wrapper components).\r\nWell, it'd be nice to have at least a boolean flag to be able to disable such overlays behavior. In my view, it should be disabled by default, cause:\r\n\r\n- It may not be needed at all (like in my case, i.e., user leaves a page - what's the point to give a focus back to invisible or deleted element?);\r\n- It may be needed to give a focus to another element after overlay is dismissed (i.e., to set focus to the next form input after user filled the previous one);\r\n- It causes issues with Ionic components itself;\r\n\r\nThat said, I'll be happy with any solution you come up to, which will provide control over overlays' focus return.\r\n\r\n**Ionic info:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI                     : 6.12.3\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic\/angular 5.3.4\r\n   @angular-devkit\/build-angular : 0.1100.7\r\n   @angular-devkit\/schematics    : 11.0.7\r\n   @angular\/cli                  : 11.0.7\r\n   @ionic\/angular-toolkit        : 3.0.0\r\n\r\nCordova:\r\n\r\n   Cordova CLI       : 9.0.0 (cordova-lib@9.0.1)\r\n   Cordova Platforms : none\r\n   Cordova Plugins   : no whitelisted plugins (0 plugins total)\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res : not installed\r\n   native-run  : not installed\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v12.18.1 (C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe)\r\n   npm    : 6.14.5\r\n   OS     : Windows 10\r\n```\r\n","comments":["Thanks for the issue.

This focus management is a common accessibility behavior designed to improve the usability of applications for folks who use assistive technology such as VoiceOver or TalkBack. That being said, there may be opportunities for improvement here. Can you reproduce this issue in an Ionic starter app and provide a link to the GitHub repo?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply.\r\nI got your point about assistive technology. I didn't mean that `focus return` is undesired in all of the cases. I tried to explain that managing `focus` is quite a complicated thing and I complained that such overlay behavior's been made default and there's no way to override or control it. There were a way to introduce the same `focus return` functionality, whatever app needs it, using overlay callbacks (to be honest, I'm pretty sure that it's the app itself must implement such functionality, not the framework).\r\nAnyway, this issue is not only about this particular 'side effect' (that is just the first issue I ran into when updated Ionic). There ain't no doubts such overlay behavior introduces a lot of undesired and unexpected focus changes and keyboard show\/hides, which is unacceptable for our app. And I suppose I'm not the only one. So, I don't get actually why you need a reproducer here? If you're going to fix exactly the bug I described, it'll be a waste of time for both of us))\r\nI'm asking to put this overlay behavior under a boolean flag and this can be implemented without any reproducer, it's enough to convince you that it's highly required. Nevertheless, if you need a reproducer for some internal workflow requirements, I'll try to provide it using sample app.\r\nStill, please take a second look at my points.","> I'm asking to put this overlay behavior under a boolean flag and this can be implemented without any reproducer, it's enough to convince you that it's highly required.\r\n\r\nI do not think this is a good idea as this could result in all overlays no longer being accessible, which would be frustrating to those who use assistive technologies.\r\n\r\n> So, I don't get actually why you need a reproducer here?

I'm talking about changes, like the following (_**core\/src\/utils\/overlays.ts**_):\r\n```javascript\r\nif (opts.focusPreviousElementOnDismiss && overlay.el.tagName !== 'ION-TOAST') {\r\n  focusPreviousElementOnDismiss(overlay.el);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's it. It can be `true` by default (though I've already put my thoughts on it).\r\nAnd let me focus on this part again: it was pretty easy to implement the same `focus return` functionality in any app that needed it even without your fix (thanks to nice overlay lifecycle hooks), but it's painful to override such forced `focus return` now in apps that don't need it in some cases or don't need it at all.\r\n\r\n> The reason why I asked for a code reproduction is that I cannot reproduce the issue as described.

That's where I would differ in the implementation of the Routes in the example you have. You should register all the routes, but for the authenticated routes, create like a \"RestrictedRoute\" component that internally checked for authentication\/Authorization and Redirect internally, rather than on the main component.\r\n2) My changes were just to show the usage of the state check with in the Router; and that seems to be resolved. The rest is the logic you have to move internally and use the \"history\" object of the react-router to navigate. Let me know if this works. I made changes to the Login and handle_login event","@ar-daniel : Did it work out ?","@samuelsunil I've been working till now for a workaround with use of history object as per your suggestion. hence the delay. Before going to my findings, a quick tip in your code- the history object need not be passed from component, it can be made available in the main app where the authentication\/ history object is used. Just we need to move the IonReactRouter to the index file and wrap <App \/> component with it. As it avoids changing the underlying code, and passing history may not work\/ feasible when doing a programmatic navigation ( like in redux use case, logout to be triggered irrespective of the page he is in, etc )\r\n\r\n__Attempt for workaround & findings__\r\n\r\n__1)__\r\nMaking a history.push() or history.replace() triggers a re-analysis of the route I believe and authroutes get active. Including it a useEffect()\r\n\r\n```\r\n  let useEffectFirstRun_isAuthenticated = useRef<boolean>(true)\r\n...\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (useEffectFirstRun_isAuthenticated.current === false) {  \/\/ to avoid first run\r\n    ...\r\n      if (isAuthenticated) {\r\n        history.push('\/profile')\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        history.push('\/login')\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    useEffectFirstRun_isAuthenticated.current = false\r\n\r\n  }, [isAuthenticated])\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis now gets into the authenticated routes, but loads \/home instead of \/profile or any other auth route that is pushed. Some how the Redirect inside auth routes is always triggered. ( 1st issue )\r\n\r\n__2)__\r\nRemoving the Redirect from the authroutes now navigates properly to \/profile or any other auth page. But incorrect\/ unknown routes cannot be redirected ( this is the second issue with workaround)\r\n\r\nNext, in actual use-case where user tries to load any of auth route is auto authenticated and to be navigated to the route user first asked for. It seen in the next 2 cases.\r\n\r\n__3)__\r\nTrying simulate a server auto authenticate using timeout, (while keeping hardcoded history.push for now. Still with Redirect already disabled\r\n```\r\n  const [autoLogin, setAutoLogin] = useState<boolean>(true)\r\n...\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n\r\n    if(autoLogin === true ) {       \/\/ to simulate server based authentication\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        setIsAuthenticated(true)    \r\n      }, 1000);                   \/\/ 1 sec so its noticable \r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }, [])\r\n```\r\nnow whatever auth route is called for, auto logs in after a 1 sec,  loads the hardcoded route - in this case ('\/profile')\r\nBut does not load when same hardcoded route is tried to be loaded, wherein it loads only a blank page. ( this is 3rd issue )\r\n(I suspect, when the hardcoded route is tried to be loaded, -  initially it renders a blank page as its not authenticated, but after authentication, again when the same route is called for, tries to load the same blank render page from cache, This is a guess - I dont know how it works. )\r\n\r\n__4)__\r\nThe step here is the actual test case for the work around with history.\r\nGetting the initial route asked using the useLocation and storign in a ref obejct to be used later for history push when authenticated\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const location = useLocation()\r\n  let firstLocationRef = useRef<string>('\/')\r\n....\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    firstLocationRef.current = location.pathname\r\n    console.log('firstLocationRef.current - ')\r\n    console.log(firstLocationRef.current)\r\n...\r\n  }, [])\r\n...\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (useEffectFirstRun_isAuthenticated.current === false) {\r\n\r\n      console.log('Authentication state - ', isAuthenticated)\r\n      if (isAuthenticated) {\r\n\r\n        console.log(`-> pushing ->  history.replace(${firstLocationRef.current})`)\r\n        history.push(firstLocationRef.current)\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        console.log(\"-> pushing -> history.replace('\/login')\")\r\n        history.push('\/login')\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    useEffectFirstRun_isAuthenticated.current = false\r\n\r\n  }, [isAuthenticated])\r\n\r\n```\r\nnow it does not load any auth route as because whatever route is asked for is the same route that is pushed in the history.push upon authentication. Suspected reason in the previous point.\r\n\r\n__Worked out sample code__\r\nAll the four vairants are uploaded in the below stackblitz link\r\nTo make checking easier, 4 different app files are present and can turned on\/off in the index js based on the case for testing.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionicreact-ts-issue-workaround-conditional-routing?file=src%2Findex.tsx\r\n\r\nPl fork the repo to local computer and test it as I've not ensured it works\/ testable  online in stackblitz.\r\n\r\nUsing the history.push or history.replace seemed like a good workaround. but didn't work for the above reasons.\r\n\r\nIn any case there is basic issue present in the ionic framework which need to be checked - so that the original problem be resolved or even for the workaround with history object to work, as its already working without issues in plain react.\r\n\r\nI already tired to work it out for 8 days but no luck.\r\n__Requesting Ionic team to help in the matter as its a real bottleneck. Thanks__\r\n\r\n ","@ar-daniel - we solved this writing a `ProtectedRoute` component that checks auth status and redirects the user in the render prop of the `Route` component if the user is not authenticated. `ProtectedRoute` takes the same props as `Route`.  If the user navigates to a protected route, the render prop of the `Route component will either return the \u201cprotected route\u201d if the user is authenticated and if not redirect the user to the login page.

And not before first time the routes are rendered. (Setting the authentication status prior to render of component would not pose a problem. ) In effect, it actually needs re-render upon authentication status change. \r\nIs this a similar case in your application as well ?\r\n\r\nAnd by protected routes, is it the same ones as above in my prev comment that you are referring or do you have a different style ?","> both these snippets are added in the variants of workaround.\r\nhttps:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionicreact-ts-issue-workaround-conditional-routing?file=src%2Findex.tsx\r\n\r\n> now the second test case above is enabled in the index.js file\r\n\r\nI hadnt saved the files earlier in Stackblitz, hence it might be missed in the online repo.

We do have a few other use cases where we redirect by setting `window.location.href` to get the behavior we need.  Maybe that's a solution for you?  Meaning, have a hook that listens for your auth status and redirect via `window.location.href` if it changes?","Hey all, I wanted to provide an update on this one.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the issue is that IonRouterOutlet doesn't currently support swapping out routes here and there well (like using one set of routes for authenticated users and one set of routes for non-authed users). This is something we want to support well and are working on it, but it is a large change and is taking time to go through and test. Hopefully we will have an update for it soon.","@ar-daniel I believe `<IonRouterOutlet>` will render all routes whose path will match - unlike `<Switch>` - which might explain the behavior you're observing.","hey, @elylucas it's been a few months, any updates? we have run into this bug trying to upgrade to the latest version of ionic-react and we seem to be blocked. ","Hey all, I'm also having the same issue here too. I've got a private route component that I'm using with an auth check described below.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nconst PrivateRoute: React.FC<PrivateRouteProps> = (props) => {\r\n  \/\/ Watch Authentication!\r\n  const { userId } = useContext(UserContext)\r\n  return (\r\n    <Route\r\n      path={props.path}\r\n      exact={props.exact}\r\n      render={() => {\r\n        return userId ? <props.component \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>\r\n      }} \/>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when I use this in combination with a `history.push('\/<new_route')` I see two transition animations.

I _think_ the crux is an implicit `computedMatch` property (~ `match`) that is normally passed from `IonRouterOutlet` (and `<Switch>`) to all child `Route`s. Guessing Ionic is using this to control animations.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst PrivateRoute: React.FC<PrivateRouteProps> = ({ component, ...rest }) => {\r\n  \/\/ Watch Authentication!\r\n  const { userId } = useContext(UserContext)\r\n  return (\r\n    <Route\r\n      {...rest}\r\n      render={() => {\r\n        return userId ? <component \/> : <Redirect to=\"\/login\" \/>\r\n      }} \/>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat works for us, though routing still breaks after logging out\/in more than once.","> hey, @elylucas it's been a few months, any updates? we have run into this bug trying to upgrade to the latest version of ionic-react and we seem to be blocked.\r\n\r\nHi @pdsullivan, we've also run into this bug, have you guys already have a work around on this one? we're using the latest ionic version v7 by the way.","same bug.

It's a really bad UX right now. I would request higher priority for this issue. ","I don't think there's a good workaround right now. I was thinking of a solution and it might make sense to only call `cancelActive` if the `ionGestureCaptured` event comes from certain components that would benefit from having `cancelActive` called.\r\n\r\nFor example, it doesn't really make a difference to cancel the gesture on an `ion-button`, but an `ion-reorder` would get messed up with conflicting gestures.\r\n\r\nI likely will not have time to tackle this soon, but feel free to take a look at it yourself -- I'm happy to review a PR for it. The change probably needs to be made in this file: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/core\/src\/utils\/tap-click.ts#L150. I imagine it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst allowList = ['ion-button'];\r\ndoc.addEventListener('ionGestureCaptured', (event) => {\r\n  \/\/ if event target is NOT in allow list of components\r\n    \/\/ call cancelActive()\r\n  \/\/ otherwise return\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pseudo code would only call cancelActive if the gesture was not captured on `ion-button`. There may be other components to add to the allowList, but we can add them on an as needed basis.\r\n\r\nSince `ionGestureCaptured` is a custom event, we might need to pass in the element target here: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/b40f7d36d5802251a0b44a7dd2599f19dbe977d5\/core\/src\/utils\/gesture\/gesture-controller.ts#L44.

What I sorely miss in Ionic 4+. The reason I've created an own directive with Ionic Gestures. Anyway... \r\n\r\nIn this case the `ion-reorder` wants to disable the ripple effect. In other cases you want to keep the ripple effect. For example, when Ionic official supports the `tap` and `press` events again. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Another suggestion is to set this as an option. Disable ripple effect (boolean) in the `GesturesController`. Would this possible? It's maybe more simpler and controllable as the allow list in the custom captured event.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Gesture, GestureController } from '@ionic\/angular';\r\n\/* ... *\/\r\nconstructor(private gestureCtrl: GestureController) {\r\n  const gesture: Gesture = this.gestureCtrl.create({\r\n    el: this.element.nativeElement,\r\n    threshold: 15,\r\n    gestureName: 'my-gesture',\r\n    onMove: ev => this.onMoveHandler(ev),\r\n    disableRippleEffect: true \/* <<< *\/\r\n  }, true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMaybe another name or inverted. But I hope I was able to explain my proposal well. So with this option you (Ionic internal and the user) have the control over it. It's more related... But I'm not fully involved to the Ionic sources. What do you think about?","Just to be clear, the Ionic team did not implement `tap` and `press`. Those were provided by Hammer.js, and Ionic v3 bundled Hammer.js with all Ionic apps.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion on how to resolve the issue! Unfortunately, I do not think that adding an API to the gesture utility is a good idea. As I mentioned in https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/22491#issuecomment-726797867 the problem is not with the gesture utility but with how the framework's other utilities respond to gestures being captured. I am not 100% set on the my initial solution, but something along those lines probably would resolve this issue while still being fairly flexible towards other components that have gestures.","I know that Hammer.js was used. But has been removed from Ionic anyway. So it makes no difference. But if I understood it correctly, it is planned to implement such events in the future. I can also understand why the decision was made to kick Hammer.js. It's obsolete and may not fit in optimally. All fine... But it would be nice if Ionic already provided these events. That was just an unpleasant surprise for the Ionic 3 migration. ...\r\n\r\nBack to the issue, I wonder what happens if the event `ionGestureCaptured` is ignored? Especially for the `ion-reorder`. What was the issue? What's wrong to trigger ripple effect in this case? Perhaps there are cases where the ripple effect is desired and other cases it is not. It depends on the gesture type like tap, press or move etc. If we now determine which elements allow this and which do not, it may not always be intended that way. ... Anyway, elements like buttons (ion-fab-button, ion-button) should never disable it. \ud83e\udd14 So your solution would resolve it. \ud83d\ude4f Hopefully as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I'm still looking for a workaround. \ud83d\udd27 \r\n\r\nUpdate: My current workaround is to add following in e.g. main.ts:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\r\n  'ionGestureCaptured',\r\n  (event) => {\r\n    event.stopPropagation();\r\n  },\r\n  true\r\n);\r\n```\r\n[Demo](https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic-gestures-ripple-bug-workaround?embed=1&file=src\/main.ts) - It just captures the event and stops propagation to its childs. So, the document never receives the event anymore. Works \ud83d\udc4d (I don't use ion-reorder or elements who should listen to it yet.)\r\n","> Back to the issue, I wonder what happens if the event ionGestureCaptured is ignored? Especially for the ion-reorder. What was the issue? What's wrong to trigger ripple effect in this case?\r\n\r\nIn the case of `ion-reorder`, the ripple effect should only be applied after a tap\/click completion. The problem is that between mobile and desktop taps and clicks are handled slightly differently. This is where our tap click utility comes into play and helps bridge the gap between the two: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/core\/src\/utils\/tap-click.ts. If we did not call `cancelActive` when `ionGestureCaptured` is fired, then you would see the ripple effect applied to `ion-reorder` when you click and drag it which is not correct.\r\n\r\n> Anyway, elements like buttons (ion-fab-button, ion-button) should never disable it.\r\n\r\nAgreed, `ion-fab-button` should be on the list of excluded components when it comes to calling `cancelActive`.\r\n\r\n> Demo - It just captures the event and stops propagation to its childs. So, the document never receives the event anymore. Works \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nNice! Glad you were able to find a workaround. ","I came across this rather annoying bug whilst trying to allow long-taps on a button to trigger the click event.  Thanks @infacto for the work around.  I thought I'd add a little tweak which allows you to filter out the added touch events, and leave others active (if you have controls that need it).  Adjust the gesture name to match that of the touch gesture that you create and add the snippet to main.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\r\n  'ionGestureCaptured',\r\n  (event: any) => {\r\n    if (event.detail?.gestureName === 'your-custom-gesture-name-goes-here'){\r\n      event.stopPropagation();\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  true\r\n);\r\n```"],"labels":["help wanted","package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"feat: Complete CSS flex utilities by display and flex properties.","body":"# Feature Request\r\n\r\n**Ionic version:**\r\n[x] **5.x** (5.4.3)\r\n\r\n**Describe the Feature Request**\r\nIt's a great idea to provide these css utilities. Every great UI framework should have it. But some essential css utilities are missing. \r\nFor example a class for `display: flex` and `flex: 1` etc. Nothing special, only the very common flex attributes.\r\n\r\n**Describe Preferred Solution**\r\nA good example is [Vuetify](https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/styles\/flex\/#enabling-flexbox) (and [here](https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/styles\/display\/#display)). I thinking about classes like: \r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.ion-flex-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ion-flex-column {\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ion-flex {\r\n  flex: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\/* And utilities for display attr. like: (or .ion-d-block) *\/\r\n.ion-display-block {\r\n  display: block;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ion-display-flex {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe Alternatives**\r\nI could create my own global classes. But it would be more consistent when these is provided by the UI framework itself. And it's about avoiding global styles.\r\n\r\n**Related Code**\r\nSee the Ionic [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/v5.4.3\/core\/src\/css\/flex-utils.scss) and [docs](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/layout\/css-utilities#flex-properties). \r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nI understand that the current flex classnames are only for modification of alignment in a flex container (e.g. from an Ionic element.) But it would be great if Ionic provides such CSS utilities (like Vuetify) to allow e.g. flex layouts with no need of custom CSS. It's not a question what the developer can or should create. In this case, I could create the whole UI framework like Ionic. It's more a philosophical question about what can a UI framework provide for UI stuff to make the life of developers easier. A build-in solution with no need to add more dependencies or custom css. Providing the power to make something awesome. See it as an idea and decide whether to close it or do it. ... I don't want to compare UI frameworks. So sorry that I notice [Vuetify](https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/) again. But I like the way to break imaginary blockages of the strict material design. In my opinion we should not follow incomprehensible restrictions when it's restricts our creativity and freedom. But maybe another topic.

I guess that makes some sense. Though... is more worrying than if this were an Ionic bug. Ionic bugs are more easily fixed... I'll be interested to hear what the Safari folks say. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to disable the Ionic menu animation\/function if Safari has started navigating back?\r\n\r\nI did some digging and found a 'hack' that seems to disable edge swiping... sometimes. I turned it into a directive to make it easier to apply\/test, but it seems like there's some timing issue as it only sometimes prevents the default Safari back action.\r\n\r\nEssentially listen for the touchstart event and prevent default if it's near the edge.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this hack needs to be applied directly on the top-level element from which the event was fired to have any type of success. Again, I'm guessing there's some kind of timing issue on Safari here, unless I've incorrectly registered the non-passive listener somehow.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst EDGE_THRESHOLD = 10;\r\n\r\n@Directive({\r\n  selector: '[stopEdgeSwipe]'\r\n})\r\nexport class StopEdgeSwipeDirective {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private _el: ElementRef) {\r\n    this._el?.nativeElement?.addEventListener('touchstart', (e: Event) => {\r\n      const event = (<any>e);\r\n      if (event.pageX === undefined || event.pageX === null\r\n        || (event.pageX > EDGE_THRESHOLD\r\n          && event.pageX < window.innerWidth - EDGE_THRESHOLD)\r\n      ) {\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n      e.preventDefault(); \/\/ This only sometimes works, and the event never appears as if the default has been prevented after calling this.

I agree that `replaceUrl: true` would likely solve the problem since the browser history would constantly be replaced with the next state. This might be possible.\r\n\r\nOne snag, however, It does not appear to be possible to apply `replaceUrl: true` globally, unless I'm missing something. So this would need to be added to all links and calls to `Router.navigate` and `NavController.navigate`. Am I missing a hook somewhere?","@liamdebeasi Also, I did some testing and I think `replaceUrl` also needs to be accompanied by `skipLocationChange: true` for that workaround to really work, which has the effect of... actually breaking all back buttons.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the browser still seems to record the history state (not sure why, I may have done something wrong.)\r\n\r\nCould be useful, but may only be reasonable on PWA\/native. Even so, you'd have to do some manual state saving of the current route to return users to where they left off.\r\n\r\nI'll do some more testing.","Working on an interceptor for the built in angular `Router`:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/45514970\/angular-2-override-router-navigate-method","Update. `{ replaceUrl: true }` seems to be all that is required.

This solution does not work for Chrome based browsers\/PWAs.

Both functionalities are triggering when they were designed to be triggered. The problem is that they conflict and interfere with the functionality of Ionic Framework's STGB.\r\n\r\n## Is there a solution?\r\n\r\nThe long term solution is for browser vendors to expose an API that allow web developers to control this behavior. I created a proposal for the W3C Pointer Events group: https:\/\/github.com\/w3c\/pointerevents\/issues\/358\r\n\r\nThere is no great short term solution. If this is a blocker for your app, I recommend disabling Ionic Framework's STGB in the application config using the `swipeBackEnabled` functionality. While this will not disable Safari's built in STGB, it will at least prevent the two gestures from interfering.\r\n\r\nIonic Angular config: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/angular\/config#config-options\r\nIonic React config: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/react\/config#config-options\r\nIonic Vue config: https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/vue\/config#config-options\r\n","For hybrid apps of the iOS version, is it possible to disable the back gesture through settings?\r\nThis can solve at least part of the problem\r\nhttps:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/webkit\/wkwebview\/1414995-allowsbackforwardnavigationgestu","Apps running as a PWA do not have access to that API.

In my opinion there should be a big fat warning in the Ionic docs for the WebHistory and WebHashHistory router history modes that default swipe back behavior is basically broken with these router modes for PWAs. The \"almost fix\" is to set `swipeBackEnabled: false` in the global Ionic config, but then you still get the Ionic swipe back animation playing after the browser's native swipe transition. `animated: false` is not a satisfying solution, because I don't want to disable _all_ animations. Why not disable the animation automatically when swipeBackEnabled is false (keep it when tapping the back button)? Anyway, for now sticking to the memory history.

It won\u2019t render the specific platform mode inferred from the user agent like it does when using browser rendering.\r\n\r\nAlso, there\u2019s no way to specify a custom mode for the `IonicServerModule` (something similar to the config option available with `IonicModule.forRoot({...})`)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nShould be able to specify a mode to render the app in the `IonicServerModule`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n**Scenario 1:** No custom config on the `IonicModule.forRoot({...})`\r\n1. Enable (SSR with Angular Universal And Ionic)[https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/blog\/ssr-with-angular-universal-and-ionic\/]\r\n2. Run `npm run dev:ssr`\r\n3. Open Chrome dev tools and emulate an iOS device\r\n4. The app doesn't recognize the iOS device and always renders with `'md'` mode\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2:** Hardcoding `'ios'` mode on the `IonicModule.forRoot({...})` config\r\n1. Enable (SSR with Angular Universal And Ionic)[https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/blog\/ssr-with-angular-universal-and-ionic\/]\r\n2. Run `npm run dev:ssr`\r\n3. Open Chrome dev tools and emulate an iOS device, also disable javascript (in order to properly test SSR)\r\n4. The app doesn't recognize the hardcoded `'ios'` mode and always renders with `'md'` mode\r\n\r\n**Note:** In _Scenario 2_ if we enable javascript to allow the transition between SSR and the browser, we first get the app with `'md'` mode and then it transitions to `'ios'` mode. Having an option to config the `mode` in the `IonicServerModule` would avoid this flick.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\nI know there are some SSR gotchas to be aware of. There's no way to access the _window_ object or the _navigation user agent_ to detect the correct mode.\r\n\r\n**However there are ways to detect the user agent in the server side using for example the request user-agent headers.**\r\n\r\nBy adding a way to specify the Ionic config through a provider (instead or in addition to the `IonicModule.forRoot({...})`) it would be possible to define the proper mode in SSR.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking something like the `APP_INITIALIZER`\r\n\r\n#### server.ts (option 1)\r\nWe can set a custom header in the response object and get that value in the `app.module.ts` using the `RESPONSE` injection token.\r\n``` typescript\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res) => {\r\n  \/\/ Add custom header to the response we send to our Angular app. We will get this custom header in the AppModule APP_INITIALIZER\r\n  res.set('mobile-device', 'ios');\r\n\r\n  res.render(\r\n    indexHtml,\r\n    {\r\n      req,\r\n      res\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### server.ts (option 2)\r\nOr we can override a new provider that handles the Ionic config directly in the `server.ts`. For this approach we would need to create a new InjectionToken for the `NEW_IONIC_CONFIG`.\r\n``` typescript\r\nserver.get('*', (req, res) => {\r\n  res.render(\r\n    indexHtml,\r\n    {\r\n      req,\r\n      res,\r\n      providers: [\r\n        {\r\n          provide: NEW_IONIC_CONFIG,\r\n          useValue: {\r\n            mode: 'ios'\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### app.modeule.ts\r\nThen in the `app.module.ts` we can easily get the config from the angular `RESPONSE` injection token or directly from the new `NEW_IONIC_CONFIG` token.\r\n``` typescript\r\n{\r\n  provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n  useFactory: (platformId: object, response: any) => {\r\n    return () => {\r\n      \/\/ In the server.ts we added a custom response header with information about the device requesting the app\r\n      if (isPlatformServer(platformId)) {\r\n        if (response && response !== null) {\r\n          \/\/ Get custom header from the response sent from the server.ts\r\n          const mobileDeviceHeader = response.get('mobile-device');\r\n          console.log('mobileDeviceHeader', mobileDeviceHeader);\r\n\r\n          \/\/ Set Ionic config mode?\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        console.log('not server');\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n  deps: [PLATFORM_ID, [new Optional(), RESPONSE]],\r\n  multi: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Ionic info:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI                     : 6.11.8 (\/Users\/agustin\/.npm-global\/lib\/node_modules\/@ionic\/cli)\r\n   Ionic Framework               : @ionic\/angular 5.3.3\r\n   @angular-devkit\/build-angular : 0.1001.2\r\n   @angular-devkit\/schematics    : 10.1.2\r\n   @angular\/cli                  : 10.1.2\r\n   @ionic\/angular-toolkit        : 2.3.3\r\n\r\nCapacitor:\r\n\r\n   Capacitor CLI   : 2.4.1\r\n   @capacitor\/core : 2.4.1\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res (update available: 0.15.1) : 0.11.0\r\n   native-run                             : not installed\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v12.14.1 (\/usr\/local\/bin\/node)\r\n   npm    : 6.14.8\r\n   OS     : macOS Catalina\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mhartington I know you have been working with the [`IonicServerModule`](https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/packages\/angular-server\/src\/ionic-server-module.ts).

The components I use for each of them are described below.\r\n\r\nFrom some inspection using the devtools, I noted that the way the routing was done, was that when I for example entered a private route, the IonPage tag of that component would get a z-index of 101 and the IonPage of all other routes would get a z-index of 100 and a class name ion-page-hidden which added display: none !important.\r\n\r\nThe problem I am experiencing is that sometimes this class is added to the wrong component and for example for the route '\/show' I get the component which is supposed to be shown for route '\/settings'. There are even cases when all Components show at once stacked all with z-index 101 and a class named 'can-go-back'.\r\n\r\nI found from some other issues that there might be problems when the route components do not have an IonPage component, but all the components I am using for my pages all have the following 'template'\r\n```jsx\r\n<IonPage>\r\n    <IonHeader> ... <\/IonHeader>\r\n    <IonContent> ...<\/IonContent>\r\n<\/IonPage>\r\n```\r\nso I don't think this is the case.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n<!-- Describe what the behavior would be without the bug. -->\r\nThe right component shows at every route\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n<!--  Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue, especially if you are able to provide a sample application. -->\r\nMy App.tsx looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<MyReactContext.Provider value={...}>\r\n   <IonApp>\r\n        <IonReactRouter>\r\n             <IonSplitPane contentId=\"main\">\r\n                 <Menu \/>\r\n                 <IonRouterOutlet id=\"main\">\r\n                    ...all routes here\r\n                 <\/IonRouterOutlet>\r\n             <\/IonSplitPane>\r\n       <\/IonReactRouter>\r\n   <\/IonApp>\r\n<\/MyReactContext.Provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Related code:**\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are able to illustrate the bug or feature request with an example, please provide a sample application via one of the following means:\r\n\r\nA sample application via GitHub\r\n\r\nStackBlitz (https:\/\/stackblitz.com)\r\nIonic Angular StackBlitz: https:\/\/stackblitz.com\/edit\/ionic-v4-angular-tabs\r\n\r\nPlunker (http:\/\/plnkr.co\/edit\/cpeRJs?p=preview)\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThe components used for the routes are these:\r\n```jsx\r\nconst PrivateRoute: React.FC<Props> = ({\r\n  component: Component,\r\n  render: _render,\r\n  ...rest\r\n}) => {\r\n  const isLoggedIn = useSelector((store: RootState) => store.auth.isLoggedIn);\r\n  return (\r\n    <Route\r\n      {...rest}\r\n      render={props =>\r\n        isLoggedIn ?

As suggested, this looks like an issue when using PrivateRoute (using Route worked fine for me).","@liamdebeasi  Thank you for the reply!\r\nSomething else I have noticed, If I use BrowserRouter and Switch instead of IonReactRouter and IonRouterOutlet it works fine, which made me think probably these components were the ones causing the error. ","> I found from some other issues that there might be problems when the route components do not have an IonPage component\r\n\r\nI faced similar issues. Some of my routes were rendering containers \/ controllers that are just FC that using hooks to combine some logic and render UI page (which has IonPage), e.g.\r\n```\r\nconst PageController = () => {\r\n   const [state, setState] = useState('');\r\n   return <PageView state={state} setState={setState} \/>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had issues with a transitions and with router params, so I needed to make it like that:\r\n```\r\nconst PageController = () => {\r\n   const [state, setState] = useState('');\r\n   return <IonPage>\r\n       <IonContent>\r\n            <PageView state={state} setState={setState} \/>\r\n       <IonContent \/>\r\n   <IonPage \/>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides that right now I'm struggling with getting params from the router, I have url like that:\r\n```\r\n<Route\r\n            path=\"\/sub-route\/:someParam\/page\"\r\n            render={(props) => {\r\n              \/\/ TODO: define why someParam is not available\r\n              return <PageController transactionId={props.match.params.someParam} \/>;\r\n            }}\r\n            exact\r\n\/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, when I'm opening the route pushing it from other places - params are empty. But, if I just reload the page - param for the totally same URL are available.\r\n\r\nIssue goes when I use Switch.\r\n\r\n@JovanShandro I found that issue goes even if you just replace IonRouterOutlet with Switch. IonReactRouter\/BrowserRouter does not really matters.","Something the Ionic team do a poor job of documenting is that the `<IonRouterOutlet>` does _not_ function the same way as React Router's `<Switch>`: it will render all Route components whose path matches, rather than just the first one. \r\n\r\n@JovanShandro your example is not accessible so I couldn't see if this is relevant but it caused me a lot of headaches recently so maybe it'll help","Did anyone end up developing an example with PrivateRoutes that works correctly within Ionic's router? I've been struggling with this for months trying to get something to work...lots of routing bugs when using private routes \/ authentication  and tabs.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/issues\/23521"],"labels":["package: react","type: bug"]},{"title":"feat: return data from modal even when not explicitly calling dismiss method","body":"<!-- Before submitting an issue, please consult our docs (https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you are posting an issue pertaining to the Ionic Framework.

Maybe we are using the Modal in a wrong way? I am using a \"page\", which I open with a Modalcontroller in Angular. So I can't use it as an \"inline Modal\". The controller itself is not able to listen to `@Output` variables. So the things happening inside the Modal are totally black boxed for the parent.\r\n\r\nSo. Imagine in that Modal page a user can enter or change various data, add new items etc. When the user presses \"Save\", then the dismiss function is called within the Modal window and data is sent back to the parent. So far so good. Like expected and it's just a wonderful UX. But. When the user swipes the modal, all the data is lost. No chance to intercept here. Of course I could prevent \"dismissing by swiping\" with the usage of an async function, but then the whole nice behavior of a modal is obsolete.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, why can we manually dismiss a modal with data, while the normal dismissing by swipe does not send any data at all? I still have not found a proper solution, even in the new documentation that scenario is not covered.","I found a nice workaround by doing it the Angular native way, hopefully it helps:\r\n\r\nWhen you use the ModalController, you actually _can_ bind some methods - and therefore you can change parents (complex) objects from within the child:\r\n\r\nThe properties of the ModalController (parent):\r\n```\r\ncomponentProps: {\r\n    'ionic': isGreat,\r\n    'anotherDataVariable': data,\r\n    'submitDataToParent': ((childModalData: any) => this.data = childModalData).bind(this)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Modal Page (child) holding a lot of data:\r\n```\r\n@Input() submitDataToParent: (childData: any) => void;\r\n```\r\nYou just need to call `this.submitDataToParent()` inside the Modal Page whenever childData changes.\r\nBy doing that you won't loose any child data, when you swipe the Modal to close.\r\n"],"labels":["type: feature request","package: core"]},{"title":"bug: location.replaceState does not update url in stack controller view item","body":"<!-- Before submitting an issue, please consult our docs (https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you are posting an issue pertaining to the Ionic Framework.

That being said you should be able to manually mark fields are touched, dirty, etc, and the red\/green status lines should update automatically.\r\n\r\nDoes this resolve your issue?","Changing the `ion-item` that contains my custom input control to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ion-item lines=\"none\" class=\"item-interactive\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nfixes both the formatting of the border and display of the red\/green status. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHow does this attribute and class get set on an `ion-item` when it contains a standard Ionic input control? There must be some magic happening there.\r\n\r\nI agree that the ValueAccessor is not really intended to be overridden, which is why I asked for a way to do this as a supported feature. Implementing custom controls like this is a common use case and it would be very nice to be able to get the same behaviour as standard Ionic input controls when displayed in an `ion-list`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an element directive would be a better solution that would allow me to attach the `setIonicClasses()`, `item-interactive` and `lines=\"full\"` behaviour. I could then add this to my custom `app-file-input` control like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ion-list>\r\n    <ion-item>\r\n        <ion-label position=\"fixed\">Field 2<\/ion-label>\r\n        <app-file-input ionic-item-interactive [formControl]=\"field2\" name=\"field2\" type=\"text\"><\/app-file-input>\r\n    <\/ion-item>\r\n<\/ion-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way it would be great not to have to create my own version of Ionic's ValueAccessor. I know this is probably going to break in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I have to include `position=\"fixed\"` on my `ion-label` for the label to be displayed. This isn't needed when an `ion-input` is used.\r\n","The way this item-interactive class gets applied is components can emit an internal `ionStyle` event. Your `app-file-input` component could do the same here. In the `ngOnInit` for your `app-file-input` component, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst event = new CustomEvent('ionStyle', {\r\n  bubbles: true,\r\n  detail: {\r\n    'interactive': true,\r\n    'input': true,\r\n   }\r\n});\r\nthis.el.nativeElement.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's other configuration you can do too: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic-framework\/blob\/master\/core\/src\/components\/input\/input.tsx#L277-L286\r\n\r\nDoes this work for your use case?","Yes, this removes the need to add attributes manually. I'm still not comfortable implementing my own version of ValueAccessor as I suspect this is likely not to work over time.\r\n\r\nI've updated my sample repository to include the working options on Tab2 and Tab3.  https:\/\/github.com\/gmaughan\/ionicCustomFormControls\r\n\r\nThanks."],"labels":["type: feature request","package: angular"]},{"title":"bug: Error during routing prevents subsequent attempts to navigate; multiple Pages on screen","body":"<!-- Before submitting an issue, please consult our docs (https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you are posting an issue pertaining to the Ionic Framework.

This is different from `window.prompt` where the user is able to use the Enter key.\r\n\r\nThe general use case is for users who are working on a desktop browser and want to work from the keyboard without going back and forth to the mouse when entering information.  This is also the case for things like being able to set focus when a dialog is displayed.","For accessibility reasons, an alert should be closed if there are no interactive elements (e.g., \"close\", \"save\", etc.) with the `ESC` key. Any interaction in the alert dialog, should be tabbable and closed with either the `ENTER` key on input of the choice **OR** dismissable with the `ESC` key. This is for the most part (95%+) the behavior I have seen over the years with testing and auditing for accessibility and testing with people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nAn overlay (totally separate entity from an alert dialog) should be dismissable with either clicking off with the mouse or by initiating a trigger (an \"x\" for instance) in the overlay and then using the `ESC` key. Changing the default behavior of native HTML components is strongly discouraged."],"labels":["type: feature request","package: core"]},{"title":"feat: ion-list on ios should have top and bottom borders","body":"<!-- Before submitting an issue, please consult our docs (https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/). -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you are posting an issue pertaining to the Ionic Framework.

Any ideas on how I could dig in to this or where to look? Were you able to reproduce?\r\n\r\nI'm not really super familiar with how browsers \"decide\" if something came from a user interaction. Happy to try to chase this down.","I was able to reproduce the issue. One of the things we want to look at with Framework v6 is the API for overlay components like action sheets. I think this (and many other issues) could be solved if users could provide a template directly and bind their own event handlers.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this issue occurs because the framework manually calls the button handlers instead of binding click events directly: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic\/blob\/master\/core\/src\/components\/action-sheet\/action-sheet.tsx#L167","Hmm... interesting. That sounds like a significant change of direction for how action-sheets work. I'm not sure I'm able to envision what that would look like. I guess you'd pass in a `TemplateRef` instance for... each menu item?\r\n\r\nI got as far as `safeCall` when I looked at it earlier. The thing the confused me was that when I tried creating my own promise chains (and using async\/await) in a button (click) action, it always worked just fine, no matter how far down I got. I did not try invoking a function reference passed from somewhere else, like `safeCall` seems to do..\r\n\r\nThis seems like something: https:\/\/github.com\/ionic-team\/ionic\/blob\/master\/core\/src\/utils\/overlays.ts#L259\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the zoneGate is somehow breaking the chain? Is it known what the actual disconnect is? Feel free to stop me if this is 10000 questions \/ too many. I'm curious.","Oh, I see. I'm tired. \r\n\r\nThe framework calls (b.handler) which is passed from the template. Right. So that's where you're saying the disconnect happens. Hmm... I'll do some testing around that.\r\n\r\nI would think that if the handler were defined as an arrow function it would work, but... I guess that's not enough. I just love Safari.","Yeah, Safari\/WebKit has a restriction where the handler needs to directly tied a click event\/native browser event generated by the user in order for these APIs to work.\r\n\r\nThe v6 changes are not set in stone, so things may change. I would imagine the way you use it looks the same. Additionally, this would let Angular users declare the components in their template similar to how Ionic React users currently do.","Interesting. So if you pass the function reference, it essentially breaks the chain, is what I'm understanding. Seems strange given it's all promises under the hood. I'd expect the browser would be able to trace it back. Restriction or bug?\r\n\r\nAnyway... looking forward to V6 I guess :) Will have to think about our UI and how to work around this limitation. Adding buttons to the page is less ideal -- at least it should work though.\r\n\r\nActually, couldn't you dynamically create a template with the action handlers bound to it directly with the way things are now? It would be a bit extra code for you guys I guess, but if you're thinking about re-doing it all anyway...\r\n\r\nI guess the issue with that is error handling, but... I'm not sure how that would be different with the new approach you're describing?","Yes, this happens to me if I add window.open(link, '_system') in the onDidDismiss in v6"],"labels":["package: core","type: bug"]},{"title":"bug: Route match params not readable in lifecycle hooks in Ionic React","body":"It seems that the route match params do not get updated in the Ionic-React lifecycle hooks.\r\n\r\n**Ionic version:**\r\n[ ] **4.x**\r\n[x] **5.x**. \r\n@ionic\/react: 5.2.2\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\nWhen a route is visited again, Ionic reuses the existing page.\r\nThis is a bit different from how React does it, but as described in the [docs](https:\/\/ionicframework.com\/docs\/react\/lifecycle) there are handy lifecycle hooks available to help with it. \r\n\r\nHowever the route match params don't seem to update.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nI would expect that the match params are updated.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\nSome pseudo-code to show the issue:\r\n```\r\n  <IonApp>\r\n     <IonReactRouter>\r\n       <IonRouterOutlet>\r\n              <Route path=\"\/home\" component={Home} exact \/>\r\n              <Route path=\"\/game\/:id\" component={GamePage} exact \/>\r\n        <\/IonRouterOutlet>\r\n      <\/IonReactRouter>\r\n    <\/IonApp>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ninterface GameProps\r\n  extends RouteComponentProps<{\r\n    id: string\r\n  }> {}\r\n\r\nconst GamePage: React.FC<GameProps> = ({ match }) => {\r\n\r\nuseIonViewDidEnter(() => {\r\n    console.log('useIonViewDidEnter ', match.params.id) \/\/ always the initial id\r\n})\r\nuseEffect(() =>\r\n    console.log('useEffect', match.params.id) \/\/ always the current id\r\n})\r\nreturn <IonPage><IonContent>{ match.params.id }<\/IonContent><\/IonPage>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another part of the app:\r\n```\r\nhistory.push('\/game\/10');\r\n```\r\nand later\r\n```\r\nhistory.push('\/game\/11');\r\n```\r\nBut \r\n```\r\nconsole.log('useIonViewDidEnter ', match.params.id) \/\/ always the initial id\r\n```\r\nkeeps outputting 10 (the first)\r\n\r\n**Related code:**\r\nIf needed I can create a sample project.\r\n\r\n**Ionic info:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIonic:\r\n\r\n   Ionic CLI       : 6.10.1\r\n   Ionic Framework : @ionic\/react 5.2.2\r\n\r\nCapacitor:\r\n\r\n   Capacitor CLI   : 2.2.0\r\n   @capacitor\/core : 2.2.0\r\n\r\nUtility:\r\n\r\n   cordova-res (update available: 0.15.0) : 0.14.1\r\n   native-run                             : 1.0.0\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n\r\n   NodeJS : v14.3.0\r\n   npm    : 6.14.5\r\n   OS     : macOS Catalina\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n","comments":["Thanks for the issue!

The lifecycle hook documentation also specifies that it can happen like that.\r\n\r\n> For instance, componentDidMount fires the first time a page is displayed, but if you navigate away from the page Ionic might keep the page around in the DOM, and a subsequent visit to the page might not call componentDidMount again.

It's been a year with no fix - and it's a serious issue - Ionic lifecycle hooks not working as expected - what's the point of having them then?..","> Hi @JanMisker,\r\n> \r\n> Found this issue, you need to pass the param to useIonViewWillEnter in the dependencies list much like useEffect:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> useIonViewDidEnter(() => {\r\n>     console.log(\"useIonViewDidEnter \", match.params.id); \/\/ always the initial id\r\n>   }, [match.params.id]);\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Give that a try and let us know.\r\n> \r\n> And sorry, I don't think thats documented, so we will get that updated.\r\n\r\nStill no mention of this in the documentation plus I'm still stuck with this issue.","@kaloczikvn can you try this:\r\n```\r\nconst getId = useCallback(() => {\r\n  return match.params.id;\r\n}, [match.params]);\r\n\r\nuseIonViewDidEnter(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"useIonViewDidEnter \", getId());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've come across this bug a couple of times, and my understanding is that `useIonViewDidEnter` falls outside of the scope of the Functional Component. Calling a method inside the scope should return the correct id (not too sure if you'll actually need the callback, I'm writing this from the top of my head but this should be the most robust solution at this point).","@hansvn: How can I use this inside a React Context? I can also move that context inside the Router components, if this is needed. But a React Context doesn't have `useIonViewDidEnter` support, or does it?","> @hansvn: How can I use this inside a React Context? I can also move that context inside the Router components, if this is needed. But a React Context doesn't have `useIonViewDidEnter` support, or does it?\r\n\r\nWhat I've learned meanwhile is that you can pass some props to the second argument of the `useIonViewDidEnter` hook (it's not referenced in the docs). This acts much like the `useCallback` hook. You could try this to bind it to the context:\r\n```js\r\nuseIonViewDidEnter(() => {\r\n    ...\r\n}, []);\r\n```","@hansvn: Yes, `useIonViewDidEnter` is intended to be used for this - however - I noticed that it is also invoked when the page\/route is currently not shown in the app! I found no way getting around this issue.\r\nCurrently I am using the properties of the `RouteComponentProps` prop passed down by the Ionic React Router to a view\/page component:\r\n```tsx\r\ninterface ViewCategoryProps\r\n  extends RouteComponentProps<{\r\n    category: string;\r\n  }> { }\r\nconst ViewCategory: React.FC<ViewCategoryProps> = ({ match }) => {\r\n  const categorySlug = match.params.category;\r\n````\r\nFor triggering something when a page is visited (e.g. \"Order sending\" page), I currently use the `useHistory` hook with `push`:\r\n```tsx\r\n\tonClick={() => {\r\n\t\torderCtx.sendOrder();\r\n\t\thistory.push({\r\n\t\t\tpathname: '\/send',\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}}\r\n````","Any update on this issue? Our team is experiencing this problem as well, and I can see that it's already been a while, and so far I haven't seen any fixes. \r\n\r\n@mhartington maybe you could have one of your team mates take a look at this issue? Our team has been struggling with this for a like 2-3 weeks already.
