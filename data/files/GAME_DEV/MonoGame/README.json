{"markdown": "\ufeff# MonoGame\n\nMonoGame is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices using the C# programming language. It has been successfully used to create games such as [Streets of Rage 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/985890/Streets_of_Rage_4/), [Carrion](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953490/CARRION/), [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/), and [many others](https://monogame.net/showcase/).\n\nIt is an open-source re-implementation of the discontinued [Microsoft's XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx).\n\n[![Join the chat at https://discord.gg/monogame](https://img.shields.io/discord/355231098122272778?color=%237289DA&label=MonoGame&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/monogame)\n\n* [Build Status](#build-status)\n* [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms)\n* [Support and Contributions](#support-and-contributions)\n* [Source Code](#source-code)\n* [Helpful Links](#helpful-links)\n* [License](#license)\n\n## Build Status\n\nWe use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/actions) to automate builds and packages distribution of the latest MonoGame changes.
