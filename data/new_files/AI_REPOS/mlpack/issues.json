Digging into this, I found that our CMake code was using the `STB_IMAGE_FOUND` variable, but the script `CMake\/FindStbImage.cmake` doesn't always set that variable.\r\n\r\nThe correct variable to use is actually `StbImage_FOUND`, which is set by the `find_package_handle_standard_args()` CMake function.  So, I adapted our CMake configuration to use that instead, and removed the manually-set `STB_IMAGE_FOUND` variable, which actually will not be set when a user manually specifies the STB include directory.","comments":["Sidenote. It may be worthwhile to consider removing STB integration from mlpack, in order to reduce the maintenance burden. Having a dependency is an invitation for that dependency (and the associated handling of that dependency) to break things. It can be argued that mlpack's primary domain is machine learning on user supplied data, and handling of non-trivial image formats (eg. jpeg, png) should be handled by the user before passing the data to mlpack.\r\n"],"labels":["c: build system","t: bugfix"],"number":3660},{"title":"Added size check utils for Hidden Markov Models","body":"Implemented size checks using CheckSameSizes and CheckSameDimensionality utilities in Hidden Markov Models(.\/hmm\/) and completed related changes in the pull request.","comments":[],"labels":["s: needs review","s: unanswered","s: unlabeled"],"number":3659}]
