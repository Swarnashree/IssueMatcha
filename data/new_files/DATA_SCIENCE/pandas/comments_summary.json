The error is due to the O(count^2) and O(count^3) terms in the numerator and denominator equations. A potential solution is to add a check before doing the zeroing out. Additionally, there is a deviation of 3 in the kurtosis formula compared to the scipy implementation, which is due to the `bias` parameter not being set to `False` in `scipy` or `polars`."}, {"issue_title": "CLN: Enforce deprecation of argmin/max and idxmin/max with NA values", "summary": "Discussion on the potential security vulnerability in the library's encryption method and a request for a fix or workaround."}, {"issue_title": "WEB: Updating active/inactive core devs", "summary": "The finance workgroup is being updated due to Wes' inactivity.
