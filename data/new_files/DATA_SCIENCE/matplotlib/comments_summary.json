There is also a concern about the lack of development in the shared colorbar handling. Some users have provided alternative solutions using `plt.subplots()`, but there are still issues with the colorbar being associated with only one image. There is a suggestion to get rid of `axes_grid1` and improve the main library instead. Additionally, there is a reported issue with the `ngrids` parameter in the `Grid` class."}, {"issue_title": "DOC: Document axes_grid1.Grid attributes", "summary": "Discussion on the potential security vulnerability in the library's encryption method and a request for a fix or workaround."}]
