The relevant commit for the issue is also provided."}, {"issue_title": "Run GHA on Windows, drop Appveyor test", "summary": "The discussion is about replacing Appveyor with GHA (GitHub Actions) for testing the repository on Windows. The main concern is that if GHA fails, it should report back to the PR. It is also mentioned that GLCI (GitHub Actions for checking integration) runs once a day and it would make sense to have a Windows job in the repository's CI. It is also discussed that if multiple PRs are merged on a single day, the report will always end up in the latest merged PR or a second run would be needed."}, {"issue_title": "dcast() retains key incorrectly when run on .SD and the RHS contains a level matching the input key", "summary": "This issue appears to be related to #4888, possibly due to multiple columns in the output sharing the same name `a`.
