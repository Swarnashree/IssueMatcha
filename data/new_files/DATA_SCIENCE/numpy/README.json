Tests can then be run after installation with:\n\n    python -c \"import numpy, sys; sys.exit(numpy.test() is False)\"\n\nCode of Conduct\n----------------------\n\nNumPy is a community-driven open source project developed by a diverse group of\n[contributors](https://numpy.org/teams/). The NumPy leadership has made a strong\ncommitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the\n[NumPy Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/) for guidance on how to interact\nwith others in a way that makes our community thrive.\n\nCall for Contributions\n----------------------\n\nThe NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!\n\nSmall improvements or fixes are always appreciated. If you are considering larger contributions\nto the source code, please contact us through the [mailing\nlist](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) first.\n\nWriting code isn\u2019t the only way to contribute to NumPy. You can also:\n- review pull requests\n- help us stay on top of new and old issues\n- develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials\n- maintain and improve [our website](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org)\n- develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials\n- translate website content\n- help with outreach and onboard new contributors\n- write grant proposals and help with other fundraising efforts\n\nFor more information about the ways you can contribute to NumPy, visit [our website](https://numpy.org/contribute/). \nIf you\u2019re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! You can\nask on the mailing list or here, on GitHub, by opening a new issue or leaving a\ncomment on a relevant issue that is already open.\n\nOur preferred channels of communication are all public, but if you\u2019d like to\nspeak to us in private first, contact our community coordinators at\nnumpy-team@googlegroups.com or on Slack (write numpy-team@googlegroups.com for\nan invitation).\n\nWe also have a biweekly community call, details of which are announced on the\nmailing list. You are very welcome to join.\n\nIf you are new to contributing to open source, [this\nguide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) helps explain why, what,\nand how to successfully get involved.\n"}
