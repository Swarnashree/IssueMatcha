There is also a discussion about the current use of dtypes in ufunc machinery and the potential clash with loops that must only match Python integers. A suggestion is made to create a general factory for abstract DTypes where you can DType.register(). The performance impact of the current setup is discussed with a suggestion to tweak things to make the exact scalar match possible without worrying about it normally."}, {"issue_title": "BUG: Exception text when slicing with an invalid object does not report tuple as an option", "summary": "A user is experiencing issues with the installation process of the package on Windows using pip.
