The reviewers suspect it is unrelated to the current discussion. The proposed solution is to merge the PR if reminded. There is also a discussion about using .git-blame-ignore-revs, but it is not deemed necessary. The history of the array API transformations in these functions is already full of simple mechanical changes."}, {"issue_title": "[WIP] BUG: special: Fix special function errstate", "summary": "Discussion on reducing shared library to minimum set of things needed to manage shared state, with only two symbols exported. Prepending `scipy` to symbol names as suggested. One CI job still failing."}]
