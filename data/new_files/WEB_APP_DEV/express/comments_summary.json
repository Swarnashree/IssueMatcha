[{"issue_title": "Add a Threat Model", "summary": "There is a suggestion to further improve the current implementation and a proposal to potentially move the code to the `.github` repository in a later update. Additionally, there are minor edit suggestions provided."}, {"issue_title": "Update release process documentation", "summary": "There is a suggestion to switch to using GitHub releases for handling the 'hard work' of versioning and releasing, as opposed to the current method of using Express/Node.js way. The main argument is that it would require less maintenance, have less impact, and be a faster process. There is also a mention of using the semantic-release tooling. The current process is seen as heavy and not ideal for Express, which is considered just 'another library'. A new issue will be created to present this version and a simpler one for a high-level discussion."}, {"issue_title": "add Github Access Structure Overview section", "summary": "The issue discusses the need for further work on defining team names and their specific permissions in the organization. The teams and permissions suggested are: `@expressjs/express-tc` with owners role, `expressjs/project-captain` with base org member role, `@expressjs/committers` with write permissions, and `@expressjs/triagers` with triager role. The team and role definitions are discussed in detail, with a link to Github's built-in roles and a suggestion to use them where possible. The naming of teams is left out due to it being difficult, and the need for defining names and specific permissions is emphasized."}, {"issue_title": "feature: add a GitHub action to quell spam PRs", "summary": "The issue is about a surge of spam pull requests in the repository, which were found to be mostly from beginners following a specific YouTube tutorial. The discussion includes suggestions for automated solutions, such as using GitHub Actions to close PRs based on certain criteria, or implementing a rule-based spam detection system. There are also concerns about the potential maintenance burden and security risks of third-party actions. The maintainers have reached out to the video creators and are considering other measures such as adding a PR template and reviving the triage team. Some community members have also expressed interest in joining the triage team to help with moderation."}, {"issue_title": "Add dependabot", "summary": "There is a suggestion to add pull request limit and timezone settings to the repository. Additionally, there is a note regarding a previous discussion about different approaches to dependency updates for `express`, with a reminder that it will take some discussion and alignment to address this."}]
