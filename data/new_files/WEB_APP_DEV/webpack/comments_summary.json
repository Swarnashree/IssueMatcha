[{"issue_title": "docs: add new html-bundler-webpack-plugin to plugins list in README", "summary": "Maintainer task: This issue requires documentation and backporting to webpack 4 after merging."}, {"issue_title": "Webpack BannerPlugin with `raw` option should put `use strict` on the very first line", "summary": "There is a discussion about the placement of 'use strict' in the code generated by the BannerPlugin in webpack. The original issue was that when the output code is ESM, 'use strict' appears on the first line, which is unexpected. However, it was found that this behavior is not related to ESM or non-ESM code. The 'use strict' directive is not added by the BannerPlugin, but comes from the source code. The placement of 'use strict' changed in a certain version of webpack, which affected the user's code. The BannerPlugin is not designed for code injection, but it is possible to use it for this purpose. The issue of cloning the repository is also discussed."}, {"issue_title": "chore(deps-dev): bump terser from 5.29.1 to 5.29.2", "summary": "Maintainer task: This issue requires documentation and backporting to webpack 4 after merging."}, {"issue_title": "chore(deps-dev): bump less-loader from 8.1.1 to 12.2.0", "summary": "Maintainer task: This issue requires documentation and backporting to webpack 4 after merging."}, {"issue_title": "fix:  library module without export statement", "summary": "Maintainer-only task: This issue requires documentation and potential backporting to webpack 4. @sokra to be kept in the loop."}, {"issue_title": "fix: LoaderContext type", "summary": "Maintainers' attention required for issue resolution: CLA signing and potential tasks for maintainers including documentation and backporting to webpack 4."}, {"issue_title": "feat: Extend worklet support", "summary": "CLA not signed for commits, action required by Danielku15, documentation and backporting tasks for maintainers"}, {"issue_title": "[experiment] Implement `import defer` TC39 proposal", "summary": "Issue is ready for review, with one remaining failure due to a cancelled job taking over 60 minutes.
