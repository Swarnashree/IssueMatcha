Compiled JS and CSS can be inlined into generated HTML using the `\u00ecnline` plugin option.\r\n","comments":["<!-- identifier: admin-actions -->\n\n*For maintainers only:*\n\n* [ ] <!-- document --> This needs to be documented (issue in webpack\/webpack.js.org will be filed when merged)\n* [ ] <!-- webpack-4-backport --> This needs to be backported to webpack 4 (issue will be created when merged)"],"labels":["PR: unreviewed"],"number":18205},{"title":"Webpack BannerPlugin with `raw` option should put `use strict` on the very first line","body":"<!-- Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the GitHub Discussions. -->\r\n<!-- https:\/\/github.com\/webpack\/webpack\/discussions -->\r\n<!-- https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n1. When using BannerPlugin with `raw` option, it appends the code before `\"use strict\"`, this will cause strict mode to not function properly.\r\n2. When set `minimize` to true, `TerserPlugin` will remove `\"use strict\"` in between.\r\n\r\n**Context:** Before https:\/\/github.com\/webpack\/webpack\/pull\/13842, webpack add `\"use strict\"` inside each function, so we don't have this issue. But after this, webpack seems like shift all `\"use strict\"` to the top, that's the root cause of this issue.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nRepo to reproduce the bug: https:\/\/github.com\/anothertempore\/webpack-banner-use-strict\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. clone the repo\r\n2. run `pnpm install`\r\n3. run `pnpm build`, then check `dist\/async` file, `\"use strict\"` is not in the very first line, which is incorrect.\r\n5. change [this line](https:\/\/github.com\/anothertempore\/webpack-banner-use-strict\/blob\/main\/webpack.config.js#L26) to true, then check `dist\/async`, `\"use strict\"` will be removed.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https:\/\/gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader\/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n`\"use strict\"` statement should always in the very first line.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.90.3\r\nNode.js version: 18\r\nOperating System: MacOS\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","comments":["> When the output code is ESM, it will have \"use strict\" in the very first line, this is expected.\r\n\r\nYou don't need \"use strict\" when your output is ESM...","@alexander-akait Sorry I just updated to Non-ESM code, seems like get the same behaviour.

It only includes the `import defer` experiment, and not the `syncImportAssertion` experiment that that PR also implements.\r\n\r\nGiven that async modules cannot be deferred, the proposal is currently going ahead with eagerly evaluating async parts of deferred module graphs. However, this PR still implement the various possible strategies:\r\n- what the proposal does\r\n- ignore the `webpackDefer` marker if a module is async or has async deps\r\n- error when deferring an async module\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc\u2026 -->\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\n\r\n<!-- Note that we won't merge your changes if you don't add tests -->\r\n\r\nYes.
