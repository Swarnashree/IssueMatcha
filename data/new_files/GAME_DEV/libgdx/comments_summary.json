[{"issue_title": "Fix playback volume of mono sounds in the lwjgl3 backend", "summary": "Issue regarding difference in amplitude and frequency response of mono and stereo sounds in the repository. A PR has been submitted which improves the stereo panning but does not completely solve the problem for the reporter. Mono sounds are still not sounding good. Stereo panning would be a nice addition and does not affect the current fix. The fix does not negatively impact GWT and is expected to work for Android, but iOS is uncertain. Further testing will be done if stereo panning is implemented to see if it affects mono sources."}, {"issue_title": "Retire the gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos extension", "summary": "Discussion on issues with running libGDX tests on Mac using LWJGL 3.3.3. Suggestions include building a .jar version of the LWJGL3 tests and running it on Mac, resizing the window(s), moving them, and posting the JAR for other Mac users to test. It is also suggested to use the StartupHelper with new LWJGL3 projects for platform-specific arguments. The user has reported that the issue seems to be resolved in LWJGL 3.3.1 and later versions, but using the `-XstartOnFirstThread` argument has the advantage of continuing to render the window when it is resized."}, {"issue_title": "performance: unnecessary window.makeCurrent() in LWJGL3 backend", "summary": "A discussion on the need to set `currentWindow` and call `makeCurrent()` for multi-window support in the `Lwjgl3Application.java` file of the libgdx repository. A pull request (#7362) has been opened to address this issue."}, {"issue_title": "Add config for automatic output device fetching on gwt", "summary": "It is suggested to add a limitation notice for the GWT backend on the interface, or to throw an exception or print an error log when using `getAvailableOutputDevices` without the required flag set on GWT."}, {"issue_title": "Use official metal sources", "summary": "Discussion on the complexity of transitioning from MGLKit API to official Angle, noting that an adapter framework would need to be created and citing a related issue where the author lacks time to work on it, indicating the task's potential high effort."}]
