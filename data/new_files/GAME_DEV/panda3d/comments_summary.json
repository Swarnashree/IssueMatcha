The proposed solution is to use `setFg/set_fg` on the font to set the text color without affecting the outline. Additionally, it is suggested to include this information in the documentation and manual of the outline function."}, {"issue_title": "Implement SteamAudio SDK", "summary": "There is a discussion about the implications of using the Apache 2.0 license for the SteamAudio library in the Panda3D repository. The main concern is that the library must be distributed as open source, which is perceived as an imposition of licensing. However, it has been clarified that the Apache 2.0 license does not require the application that uses the library to be open source, only that the license terms are included. Additionally, it has been pointed out that the SteamAudio source code can be modified for Panda3D's needs and could potentially replace OpenAL-Soft as an HRTF provider, offering VR capabilities and efficient effects processing for 3D environments. The Apache license is not considered a problem for implementation."}]
