The system time in control-plane node was skew to future somehow.\r\n2. Alerts fired and SRE team address the time manually.\r\n3. There are a lots of pods keep crashing because of invalid token:\r\n  a. Tokens are not valid yet, because they are issued at 'future' time.\r\n  b. Kubelet will not routate those tokens becase they are not expired.\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this condition is to delete the pod manually, or do nothing and wait until the token be valid.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nkubelet can fix this condition automatically if the token is issued from the future.\n\n### How can we reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)?\n\n1. create a new kind cluster;\r\n1. docker exec into controlplane node, use `date -s` to change the time to 2 days later.\r\n2. wait a few minutes;\r\n3. change the time back;\r\n4. you can find a lots of pods crash because token are not valid yet.\r\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/kubernetes\/kubernetes\/assets\/4017672\/5778391a-f1ab-4772-bd71-54a9671f5835)\r\n\n\n### Anything else we need to know?\n\n_No
