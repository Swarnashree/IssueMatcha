A Candlestick chart could usually be used for that. However, Grafana only really sports those for financial and trend analyses, requiring a timeseries. I dont want to have different timeseries. I want one number-triplet (min\/avg\/max) per node, side by side.\n\n**What would you like to be added**:\nA new version of the candlestick chart which has one handle per series\/label instead of using timedata. An alternative would be an adjustment to existing charts (gauges e.g.) to allow showcasing more than one metric per widget. I know bar charts could already show this side by side, but thats quite verbose and not visually compact enough imo, we have dozens of nodes per cluster.\n\n**Who is this feature for?**\nStandard end users; data analysts.","comments":["sounds like you're asking for a BoxPlot?\r\n\r\ni think we need one in the core and i'd like to add one this year. there are external panel plugins that can do this if you need it in the short term.","I wasn't sure what the English Term is so I used the Candlechart which most closely resembles it.
